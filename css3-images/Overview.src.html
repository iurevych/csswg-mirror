Abstract</h2>

	<p>This CSS Image Values and Replaced Content module has two parts:
	First, it defines the syntax for <i>&lt;image></i> values in CSS.
	<i>&lt;image></i> values can be a single URI to an image, a list of
	URIs denoting a series of fallbacks, a reference to an element in the document, or
	gradients. Second, it defines properties used to control the
	interaction of replaced content and the CSS layout algorithms.
	These properties can affect the used image resolution for bitmaps,
	the replaced object's orientation, and whether and how to preserve
	the object's aspect ratio.</p>

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

	<p>In CSS Levels 1 and 2, image values, such as those used in the
	'background-image' property, could only be given by a single URI
	value. This module introduces additional notations that allow a
	2D image to be given as a list of URIs denoting fallbacks, as a
	reference to an element in the document, and as a gradient.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

	<p>A document or implementation cannot conform to CSS Image Values & Replaced Content Level 3
	 alone, but can claim conformance to CSS Image Values & Replaced Content Level 3 if it satisfies
	 the conformance requirements in this specification when implementing CSS or
	 another host language that normatively references this specification.</p>

	<p>Conformance to CSS Image Values & Replaced Content Level 3 is defined for three classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>minimal</dfn></dt>
		<dd>A device that does not implement CSS Transitions, CSS Animations, nor 
		CSSOM may ignore the chapters on Serializing and Interpolating values for
		the purpose of claiming conformance.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>transition-capable</dfn></dt>
		<dd>A device that implements CSS Transitions or CSS Animations must conform
		to the <i>minimal</i> class, and additionally must implement the chapter 
		on Interpolation.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>CSSOM-capable</dfn></dt>
		<dd>A device that implements CSSOM must conform to the <i>minimal</i> class, 
		and additionally must implement the chapter on Serialization.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
	"MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
	"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification. All of the text of this specification is
	normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples,
	and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words "for example"
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:

	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Informative notes begin with the word "Note" and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id='resolution-units'>
Resolution Units: the &lt;resolution&gt; value type</h2>

	<p>This specification defines the following units as part of the <dfn>&lt;resolution></dfn>
	value type:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>dpi</dfn></dt>
		<dd>dots per inch</dd>

		<dt><dfn>dpcm</dfn></dt>
		<dd>dots per centimeter</dd>

		<dt><dfn>dppx</dfn></dt> 
		<dd>dots per ''px'' unit</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The &lt;resolution> unit represents the size of a single "dot" of an image.  For raster images,
	a dot is an image pixel.  A &lt;resolution> defines how many of these dots fit in a CSS 'in', 'cm', or 'px' so that 
	images can be sized accordingly. The default resolution of raster images in CSS is ''1dppx'', 
	which is equivalent to ''96dpi''.  The concept of "resolution" does not apply to vector image
	formats like SVG; generally, this means that any attempt to change the resolution of a vector
	image is simply meaningless.  Individual uses of the &lt;resolution> value define precisely
	what effects they have on raster and vector images.</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>Printers tend to have substantially higher resolution than computer monitors; due to this,
		an image that looks fine on the screen may look pixellated when printed out.  A
		&lt;resolution> may be used in the 'image-resolution' property to embed a high-resolution
		image into the document that maintains an appropriate size, ensuring attractive display
		both on screen and on paper:</p>

		<pre class='css'><code>
img.high-res {
	image-resolution: 300dpi;
}</code></pre>

		<p>With this set, an image meant to be 5 inches wide that was saved at 300dpi will actually
		display as 5 inches wide; without this set, the image would display as approximately 15.6 inches
		wide since the image is 15000 image pixels across, and by default there are 96 image pixels per
		inch.</p>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id="image">
Image Values: the &lt;image> value type</h2>

	<p>The &lt;image> value type denotes a 2D image. It is defined as

	<pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;image></dfn> = &lt;url> | &lt;image-list> | &lt;element-reference> | &lt;image-combination> | &lt;gradient></pre>

	<p>Image values can be used in many CSS properties, including the
	'background-image', 'list-style-image', 'cursor' properties [[!CSS21]].

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="url">
Image References and Image Slices: the ''url()'' notation</h3>

	<p>The simplest way to indicate an image is to reference an image file
	by URI. This is done with the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#uri">''url()'' notation</a>,
	defined in [[!CSS21]].

	<div class="example">
		<p>In the example below, a background image is specified with ''url()''
		syntax:</p>

		<pre>background-image: url(wavy.png);</pre>
	</div>

	<p>A portion of an image may be referenced (clipped out and used as a
	standalone image) by use of
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-space">media fragment identifiers</a>.
	[[!MEDIA-FRAGS]]

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example, given the following image* and CSS:</p>

		<a href="sprites.svg">
			<img src="sprites.svg" height="20" width="180" alt="[9 circles, with 0 to 8 eighths filled in]">
		</a>

		<pre>background-image: url('sprites.svg#xywh=40,0,20,20')</pre>

		<p>...the background of the element will be the portion of the image that starts at (40px,0px)
		and is 20px wide and tall, which is just the circle with a quarter filled in.</p>

		<p><small>* SVG-in-&lt;img> support required.  Click the picture to view the SVG directly.</small></p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="note">Note that a legacy UA that doesn't understand the media
		fragments notation will ignore the fragment and simply display the
		entirety of an image specified with ''url''. However, since URLs with
		media fragment identifiers can also be used in the ''image()'' notation
		defined below, authors can take advantage of CSS's forward-compatible
		parsing rules to provide a fallback when using an image fragment URL:</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>In the example below, the ''image()'' notation is used together with
		the media fragment syntax, so that UAs that don't support media fragments
		fail to parse the second declaration and use the first.</p>

		<pre>
<!-- -->background-image: url('swirl.png'); /* old UAs */
<!-- -->background-image: image('sprites.png#xywh=10,30,60,20'); /* new UAs */</pre>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='element-reference'>
Using Elements as Images: the ''element()'' notation</h3>

	<p>The ''element()'' function allows an author to reference an element in
	the document that should be used as an image.  As the referenced element 
	changes, for example, by the user typing into a &lt;textarea> element or 
	a script drawing into a &lt;canvas> element in HTML, the image produced by 
	the ''element()'' function stays in sync, allowing dynamic effects such as 
	script-animated background images or previews of the next slide in a slideshow.  
	The syntax for ''element()'' is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod><dfn>&lt;element-reference></dfn> = element( [&lt;id-selector> | &lt;identifier> ] )</pre>

	<p>where &lt;id-selector> is an ID selector [[!SELECT]], and &lt;identifier> 
	is an identifer [[!CSS3VAL]].</p>

	<p>If the argument to the ''element()'' function is an ID selector, the 
	function references the element matched by the selector.  If it's an identifier, 
	the function references the element whose <dfn>CSS element reference identifier</dfn> 
	is the given identifier.  (CSS does not define how an element acquires a 
	<i>CSS element reference identifier</i>; that is determined by the host language.)  
	If no element in the document matches the selector, or no element has the 
	identifier as its <i>CSS element reference identifier</i>, the function 
	represents a fully transparent image with no intrinsic dimensions, equivalent 
	to <code>image(transparent)</code>.  If the document changes so that which 
	element is matched, or whether an element is matched at all, changes, the 
	image represented by the function must change accordingly.</p>

	<p>If the ''element()'' function refers to an element, then it represents 
	an image with width and height equal to the width and height of the margin 
	box of the referenced element.  The image must be constructed by rendering 
	the referenced element and its descendants at the same size that the element 
	would be in its document, over an infinite transparent black background, 
	positioned so that the edges of the margin box of the element is flush with 
	the edges of the image.  <span class=note>If the element has decorations 
	or descendants that extend outside the margin box, these will be clipped 
	to the margin box in the generated image by default.  ''background-repeat:extend'' 
	may allow the author to override this behavior so that decorations and 
	descendants outside the margin box are still painted.</span>  If the 
	referenced element or an ancestor of the referenced element has a transform 
	applied to it, the transform must be ignored for the purpose of constructing 
	this image (transforms on descendants must be unaffected).</p>

	<p>If the argument passed to ''element()'' isn't an ID selector or an ident, 
	it is a syntax error.</p>

	<p>Implementations may either re-use existing bitmap data generated for the 
	referenced element or regenerate the display of the element to maximize quality 
	at the image's size (for example, if the implementation detects that the referenced 
	element is an SVG fragment); in the latter case, the layout of the referenced 
	element in the image must not be changed by the regeneration process.  That is, 
	the image must look identical to the referenced element, modulo rasterization 
	quality.</p>

<h4 class="no-num no-toc" id='element-cycles'>
Detecting and Resolving Circular Relationships Introduced by ''element()''</h4>

	<p>The ''element()'' function can produce nonsensical circular relationships, 
	such as an element using itself as its own background.  These relationships 
	can be easily and reliably detected and resolved, however, by keeping 
	track of a dependency graph and using common cycle-detection algorithms.</p>

	<p>Populate the dependency graph initially by having every element depend 
	on each of its children.  Then, whenever a property on an element A uses 
	the ''element()'' function to refer to an element B, add an edge to the 
	graph by having A depend on B.  If a dependency cycle is detected, any 
	''element()'' functions that produced a dependency in the cycle represent 
	a fully transparent image with no intrinsic dimensions.</p>

	<p class=issue>Someone else needs to review this and make sure that I'm 
	not missing any cycles.</p>

<h2 id="gradients">
Gradients</h2>

	<p>A gradient is an image that smoothly fades from one color to another.  These 
	are commonly used for subtle shading in background images, buttons, and many 
	other things.  The two functions described in this section allow an author to 
	specify such an image in a terse syntax, so that the UA can generate the image 
	automatically when rendering the page.
	The syntax of a <i>&lt;gradient></i> is:</p>

	<pre class=prod><dfn>&lt;gradient></dfn> = [ &lt;linear-gradient> | &lt;radial-gradient> | &lt;repeating-linear-gradient> | &lt;repeating-radial-gradient> ]</pre>

	<p>where <i>&lt;linear-gradient></i>, <i>&lt;radial-gradient></i>,
	<i>&lt;repeating-linear-gradient></i>, and <i>&lt;repeating-radial-gradient></i> are 
	defined in their applicable sections below.</p>

	<p>Gradients are a type of image, and can be used anywhere an image can,
	such as in the 'background-image' or 'list-style-image' properties.

	<div class=example>
		<p>As with the other <i>&lt;image></i> types defined in this specification, 
		gradients can be used in any property that accepts images.  For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>background: linear-gradient(white, gray);</code></li>
			<li><code>list-style-image: radial-gradient(circle, #006, #00a 90%, #0000af 100%, white 100%)</code></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>A gradient is drawn into a box with the dimensions of the <i>concrete
	object size</i>. Elsewhere in this section this rectangle is simply
	called the "box".

	<p>A gradient has no <i>intrinsic dimensions</i>.  This means that, for
	example, if you use a gradient in the 'background-image' property (with
	'background-size' at the default value and 'background-repeat' not equal to 
	'round'), the box will simply be the size of the background sizing 
	area. Similarly, for a gradient used as a list-style-image, the box
	would be a 1em square.

	<p class=issue>It has been suggested that several of the controls offered by gradients are unnecessary. Repeating gradients could potentially be done by hooking into ‘background-repeat’, sizing and positioning radial gradients could be done by hooking into ‘background-size’ and ‘background-position’, etc.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='linear-gradients'>
Linear Gradients</h3>

	<p>A linear gradient is created by specifying a gradient-line and then several 
	colors placed along that line.  The image is constructed by creating an 
	infinite canvas and painting it with lines perdendicular to the gradient-line, 
	with the color of the painted line being the color of the gradient-line 
	where the two intersect.  This produces a smooth fade from each color to 
	the next, progressing in the specified direction.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h4 class='no-toc' id='linear-gradient-syntax'>
linear-gradient() syntax</h4>

	<pre class=prod><code><dfn>&lt;linear-gradient></dfn> = linear-gradient(
	[[ &lt;angle> | upward | rightward | leftward | downward ],]? 
	&lt;color-stop>[, &lt;color-stop>]+
	);</code></pre>

	<p>The first argument to the function specifies the <dfn>gradient-line</dfn>, 
	which gives the gradient a direction and determines how color-stops are 
	positioned.  It may be omitted; if so, it defaults to "downward".</p>

	<p>The <i>gradient-line</i> may be specified in two different ways.  The 
	first is by specifying the angle the <i>gradient-line</i> should assume; 
	for the purposes of this argument, 0deg points upwards, 90deg points toward
	the right, and positive angles go clockwise.  
	The starting-point and ending-point of the <i>gradient-line</i> are 
	determined by extending a line in both directions from the center of the 
	box at the angle specified.  In the direction of the angle, the ending-point 
	is the point on the <i>gradient-line</i> where a line drawn perpendicular 
	to the <i>gradient-line</i> would intersect the corner of the box in that 
	direction.  The starting-point is determined identically, except in the 
	opposite direction of the angle.</p>

	<p>Alternately, a keyword may be used to indicate the <i title="gradient-line">gradient-line's</i> direction.  The "upward" keyword places the starting-point of the gradient-line in the center of the bottom edge of the box and the ending-point of the <i>gradient-line</i> in the center of the top edge of the box, similar to how a value of "0deg" works.  The "rightward", "downward", and "leftward" keywords are defined the same, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<div style="overflow: hidden">
			<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;" src='gradient-diagram.png' alt="[An image showing a box with a background shading gradually from white in the bottom-left corner to black in the top-right corner.  There is a line, illustrating the gradient-line, angled at 45 degrees and passing through the center of the box.  The starting-point and ending-point of the gradient-line are indicated by the intersection of the gradient-line with two additional lines that pass through the bottom-left and top-right corners of the box.]">
			<p>This example illustrates visually how to calculate the 
			<i>gradient-line</i> from the rules above.  This shows the starting 
			and ending-point of the <i>gradient-line</i>, along with the actual 
			gradient, produced by an element with 
			''background: linear-gradient(45deg, white, black);''.</p>
			<p>Notice how, though the starting-point and ending-point are outside 
			of the box, they're positioned precisely right so that the gradient 
			is pure white <em>exactly</em> at the corner, and pure black 
			<em>exactly</em> at the opposite corner.  That's intentional, and 
			will always be true for linear gradients.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>The gradient's color stops are typically placed between the starting-point 
	and ending-point on the <i>gradient-line</i>, but this isn't required - the 
	<i>gradient-line</i> extends infinitely in both directions.  The starting-point 
	and ending-point are merely arbitrary distance markers - the starting-point 
	defines where 0%, 0px, etc are located when specifying color-stops, and 
	the ending-point defines where 100% is located.  Color-stops are allowed 
	to have positions before 0% or after 100%.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h4 class='no-toc' id='linear-gradient-examples'>
Linear Gradient Examples</h4>

	<p>All of the following ''linear-gradient()'' examples are presumed to be 
	backgrounds applied to a box that is 200px wide and 100px tall.</p>

	<div class=example>	
		<p>Below are various ways of specifying a basic vertical gradient:</p>

		<pre><code>linear-gradient(yellow, blue);
linear-gradient(downward, yellow, blue);
linear-gradient(180deg, yellow, blue);
linear-gradient(upward, blue, yellow);
linear-gradient(downward, yellow 0%, blue 100%);</code></pre>

		<p><img src="linear1.png" alt="" ></p>
	</div>

	<div class=example>	
		<p>This demonstrates the use of an angle in the gradient.  Note that, though the angle is not exactly the same as the angle between the corners, the <i>gradient-line</i> is still sized so as to make the gradient yellow exactly at the upper-left corner, and blue exactly at the lower-right corner.</p>

		<pre><code>linear-gradient(135deg, yellow, blue);
linear-gradient(-45deg, blue, yellow);</code></pre>

		<p><img src="linear3.png" alt="" ></p>
	</div>

	<div class=example>	
		<p>This demonstrates a 3-color gradient, and how to specify the location of a stop explicitly:</p>

		<pre><code>linear-gradient(yellow, blue 20%, #0f0);</code></pre>

		<p><img src="linear4.png" alt="" ></p>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='radial-gradients'>
Radial Gradients</h3>

	<p>In a radial gradient, rather than colors smoothly fading from one side 
	of the box to the other as with linear gradients, they instead emerge from 
	a single point and smoothly spread outward in a circular or elliptical shape.</p>

	<p>A radial gradient is specified by first pinpointing the center of the 
	gradient, where the 0% ellipse will be, then specifying the size and shape 
	of the 100% ellipse, ending with a list of color-stops just like a linear-gradient.  
	Between the center and the ending-ellipse, and past the ending-ellipse, 
	concentric ellipses are drawn and colored according to the specified color-stops.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h4 class='no-toc' id='radial-gradient-syntax'>
radial-gradient() Syntax</h4>

	<pre class=prod>
<dfn>&lt;radial-gradient></dfn> = radial-gradient(
	[&lt;bg-position&gt;,]? 
	[[
		[&lt;shape&gt; || &lt;size&gt;]
		|
		[&lt;length> | &lt;percentage>]{2}
	],]? 
	&lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+
)
	</pre>

	<p>The first argument to the function specifies the center of the ellipse.  
	<i>&lt;bg-position></i> is taken from the Backgrounds and Borders Module, and 
	has the same definition.  It specifies the center of the gradient.  If omitted, 
	it defaults to ''center''.  Color-stop positions are measured along an 
	imaginary line extending from the center of the gradient to the right.</p>

	<p>The second argument to the function specifies the size and shape of the 
	ending-ellipse.  This can be specified in two ways, with different characteristics:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Implicitly</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The size and shape of the ending-ellipse can be defined 
			<em>implicitly</em> with a size and shape keyword.  The <i>&lt;shape></i> 
			is defined as </p>

			<pre><code><dfn>&lt;shape></dfn> = [ circle | ellipse ]</code></pre>

			<p>''circle'' indicates that the ending-ellipse will be a circle with 
			a constant radius.  ''ellipse'' indicates that the gradient-shape 
			will be an axis-aligned ellipse (that is, its major and minor radiuses 
			will be horizontal and vertical, not necessarily in that order).</p>

			<p>The <i>&lt;size></i> keyword is defined as </p>

			<pre><code><dfn>&lt;size></dfn> = [ closest-side | closest-corner | farthest-side | farthest-corner | contain | cover ]</code></pre>

			<p>If <i>&lt;shape></i> is ''circle'' and <i>&lt;size></i> is ''closest-side'', 
			the ending-shape is a circle sized so that it exactly meets the side 
			of the box closest to its center.  For example, if the box was 100px 
			wide and 200px tall, and the center of the gradient was ''10% 10%'', 
			then the closest side is the left side of the box (it is 10px from 
			the starting-point, while the top is 20px from it, and the right and 
			bottom sides are much further).  The gradient-shape would thus be a 
			circle with a radius of 10px.  If <i>&lt;shape></i> is ''ellipse'' and 
			<i>&lt;size></i> is ''closest-side'', the gradient-shape is an ellipse 
			sized so that it exactly meets the vertical and horizontal sides of 
			the box closest to its center.  Using the same box and starting-point 
			as the previous example, the gradient-shape would be an ellipse with 
			a 20px vertical radius and a 10px horizontal radius.  (If necessary, 
			such as if the starting-point is outside of the box, extend the sides 
			of the box so that there is a line the ellipse can meet.)</p>

			<p>''farthest-side'' is identical to ''closest-side'', except that 
			the gradient-shape is sized to meet the side of the box that is farthest 
			from its center (or the farthest vertical and horizontal sides, if 
			the shape is ''ellipse'').  ''closest-corner'' and ''farthest-corner'' 
			size the gradient-shape so that it exactly meets the closest or farthest 
			corner of the box from its center, respectively.  If <i>&lt;shape></i>
			is ''ellipse'', the gradient-shape has the same ratio of width to height 
			that it would if ''closest-side'' or ''farthest-side'' were specified, 
			as appropriate.  ''contain'' is a synonym for ''closest-side'', and 
			''cover'' is a synonym for ''farthest-corner''.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Explicitly</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Alternately, the ending-shape's size and shape can be defined 
			explicitly, by providing two lengths or percentages.  These measure 
			the length of the horizontal and vertical axes of the ellipse, 
			respectively.  (The axis length is the length from the center of the 
			ellipse to the edge, similar to the radius of a circle, not the 
			diameter.)</p>

			<p>Percentages used in the first value are relative to the width of 
			the box, while percentages used in the second value are relative to 
			the height of the box.</p>

			<p>Both of the values must be non-negative.  Specifying either as
			''0'' is allowed, but produces a degenerate shape.  The handling of
			degenerate ending-shapes is specified later in this specification.</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>If this argument is omitted, it defaults to ''ellipse cover''.</p>

	<p>If only one argument is provided before the color-stops, and it could
	be interpreted as either a position or an explicit size (for example, in
	''radial-gradient(10% 10%, red, blue)''), it must be interpreted as a position.</p>

	<p>In certain circumstances the given parameters may define a degenerate 
	shape - a circle or ellipse with a radius of 0. In these instances the 
	gradient image is just a solid color equal to the color of the last color-stop 
	in the rule.  The following combinations of values will trigger this: 
	''closest-side'' if the starting-point is on a box edge, ''closest-corner'' 
	if the starting-point is on a box corner, and ''ellipse closest-corner'' 
	if the starting-point is on a box edge.</p>

	<p>Color-stops are placed on an imaginary line extending from the center 
	of the gradient toward the right, with the 0% point at the center of the 
	gradient, and 100% at the point where the line intersects the ending-ellipse.  
	The color of each ellipse is equal to the color of the line where the 
	ellipse intersects it.  Distances past 100% can be specified, and simply 
	indicate a color-stop placed on the line a corresponding distance from the 
	center.  Negative distances are allowed in a radial gradient and work the 
	same as in linear gradients with respect to setting the color of the 
	<i>gradient-line</i>, but colors before the starting-point of the <i>gradient-line</i> 
	are not displayed.  For example, ''radial-gradient(red -50px, yellow 100px)'' 
	would produce an elliptical gradient which starts with a reddish-orange color 
	in the center (the color 1/3 between red and yellow) and transitions to 
	yellow at 100px wide.</p>

<h3 id='repeating-gradients'>
Repeating Gradients</h3>

	<p>In addition to the ''linear-gradient()'' and ''radial-gradient()'' functions, 
	this specification defines ''repeating-linear-gradient()'' and 
	''repeating-radial-gradient()'' functions.  These two functions take the 
	same values and are interpreted the same as their respective non-repeating 
	siblings defined previously:</p>

	<pre class=prod><code><dfn>&lt;repeating-linear-gradient></dfn> = repeating-linear-gradient(
	[[ &lt;angle> | upward | rightward | downward | leftward ],]?
	&lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+
)
<dfn>&lt;repeating-radial-gradient></dfn> = repeating-radial-gradient(
	[&lt;bg-position&gt;,]? 
	[[
		[&lt;shape&gt; || &lt;size&gt;]
		|
		[&lt;length> | &lt;percentage>]{2}
	],]? 
	&lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+
)</code></pre>

	<p>When rendered, however, the color-stops are repeated infinitely in both 
	directions, with their positions shifted by multiples of the difference 
	between the last specified color-stop's position and the first specified 
	color-stop's position.  For example, ''repeating-linear-gradient(red 10px, blue 50px)'' 
	is equivalent to ''linear-gradient(..., red -30px, blue 10px, red 10px, blue 50px, red 50px, blue 90px, ...)''.  
	Note that the last color-stop and first color-stop will always coincide at 
	the boundaries of each group, which will produce sharp transitions if the 
	gradient does not start and end with the same color.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p>Repeating gradient syntax is basically identical to that of non-repeating gradients:</p>

		<pre><code>repeating-linear-gradient(red, blue 20px, red 40px)</code></pre>
		<p><img src="repeating1.png" alt=""></p>

		<pre><code>repeating-radial-gradient(red, blue 20px, red 40px)</code></pre>
		<p><img src="repeating2.png" alt=""></p>

		<pre><code>repeating-radial-gradient(20px 30px, circle contain, red, yellow, green 100%, yellow 150%, red 200%)</code></pre>
		<p><img src="repeating3.png" alt=""></p>
	</div>

	<p>If the distance between the first and last color-stops is non-zero, but is small enough that the implementation knows that the physical resolution of the output device is insufficient to faithfully render the gradient, the implementation must <i title="gradient-average-color">find the average color of the gradient</i> and render the gradient as a solid-color image equal to the average color.</p>

	<p>If the distance between the first and last color-stops is zero (or rounds to zero due to implementation limitations), the implementation must <i title="gradient-average-color">find the average color</i> of a gradient with the same number and color of color-stops, but with the first and last color-stop an arbitrary non-zero distance apart, and the remaining color-stops equally spaced between them.  Then it must render the gradient as a solid-color image equal to that average color.</p>

	<p>To <dfn title="gradient-average-color">find the average color of a gradient</dfn>, run these steps:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Define <var>list</var> as an initially-empty list of premultiplied RGBA colors, and <var>total-length</var> as the distance between first and last color stops.</li>

		<li>For each adjacent pair of color-stops, define <var>weight</var> as half the distance between the two color-stops, divided by <var>total-length</var>.  Add two entries to <var>list</var>, the first obtained by representing the color of the first color-stop in premultiplied sRGBA and scaling all of the components by <var>weight</var>, and the second obtained in the same way with the second color-stop.</li>

		<li>Sum the entries of <var>list</var> component-wise to produce the average color, and return it.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class='note'>As usual, implementations may use whatever algorithm they wish, so long as it produces the same result as the above.</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>For example, the following gradient is rendered as a solid light-purple image (equal to <code>rgb(75%,50%,75%)</code>):</p>
		
		<pre class="css">repeating-linear-gradient(red 0px, white 0px, blue 0px);</pre>

		<p>The following gradient would render the same as the previous under normal circumstances (because desktop monitors can't faithfully render color-stops 1/10th of a pixel apart), but would render as a normal repeating gradient if, for example, the author applied "zoom:100;" to the element on which the gradient appears:</p>

		<pre class="css">repeating-linear-gradient(red 0px, white .1px, blue .2px);</pre>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='color-stop-syntax'>
Gradient Color-Stops</h3>

	<pre class=prod><code><dfn>&lt;color-stop></dfn> = &lt;color> [ &lt;percentage> | &lt;length> ]?</code></pre>

	<p>Color-stops are points placed along the line defined by the <i>gradient-line</i> 
	at the beginning of the rule.  Color-stops must be specified in order.  
	Percentages refer to the length of the gradient-line, with 0% being at the 
	starting point and 100% being at the ending point.  Lengths are measured 
	from the starting-point in the direction of the ending-point.  Color-stops 
	are usually placed between the starting-point and ending-point, but that's 
	not required; the gradient-line extends infinitely in both directions, and 
	a color-stop can be placed at any position on the line.</p>

	<p>At each color-stop, the line is the color of the color-stop.  Between 
	two color-stops, the line's color is linearly interpolated between the colors 
	of the two color-stops, with the interpolation taking place in premultiplied 
	RGBA space.  Before the first color-stop, the line is the color of the first 
	color-stop.  After the last color-stop, the line is the color of the last 
	color-stop.</p>

	<p>The following steps must be applied <em>in order</em> to process the list 
	of color-stops.  After applying these rules, all color-stops will have a 
	definite position and they will be in ascending order:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the first color-stop does not have a position, its position defaults 
		to 0%. If the last color-stop does not have a position, its position defaults 
		to 100%.</li>

		<li>If a color-stop has a position that is less than the specified position 
		of any color-stop before it in the list, its position is changed to be 
		equal to the largest specified position of any color-stop before it.</li>

		<li>If any color-stop still does not have a position, then, for each run 
		of adjacent color-stops without positions, set their positions so that 
		they are evenly spaced between the preceding and following color-stops 
		with positions.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If multiple color-stops have the same position, they produce an infinitesimal 
	transition from the one specified first in the rule to the one specified 
	last.  In effect, the color suddenly changes at that position rather than 
	smoothly transitioning.</p>

	<p class=note>It is recommended that authors not mix different types of units, 
	such as px, em, or %, in a single rule, as this can cause a color-stop to 
	unintentionally try to move before an earlier one.  For example, the rule 
	''background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow 100px, blue 50%)'' would 
	work as expected as long as the background area is at least 200px tall.  
	If it was 150px tall, however, the blue color-stop's position would be 
	equivalent to "75px", which precedes the yellow color-stop, and would be 
	corrected to a position of 100px.</p>

	<p class=note>The definition and implications of "premultiplied" color spaces 
	are given elsewhere in the technical literature, but a quick primer is given 
	here to illuminate the process.  Given a color expressed as an rgba() 4-tuple, 
	one can convert this to a premultiplied representation by multiplying the 
	red, green, and blue components by the alpha component.  For example, a 
	partially-transparent blue may be given as rgba(0,0,255,.5), which would 
	then be expressed as [0, 0, 127.5, .5] in its premultiplied representation.  
	Interpolating colors using the premultiplied representations rather than 
	the plain rgba representations tends to produce more attractive transitions, 
	particularly when transitioning from a fully opaque color to fully transparent.
	Note that transitions where either the transparency or the color are held constant (for example, transitioning between rgba(255,0,0,100%) and rgba(0,0,255,100%) or rgba(255,0,0,100%) and rgba(255,0,0,0%)) have identical results whether the color interpolation is done in premultiplied or non-premultiplied color-space.  Differences only arise when both the color and transparency differ between the two endpoints.</p>

<h2 id="sizing">
Sizing Images and Objects in CSS</h2>

	<p>Images used in CSS may come from a number of sources, from defined image 
	formats (such as gif, jpeg, etc), dedicated markup formats (such as SVG), and 
	CSS-specific formats (such as the linear-gradient() value type defined in this 
	specification).  As well, a document may contain many other types of objects, 
	such as video, plugins, or nested documents.  These images and objects (just 
	<dfn>objects</dfn> hereafter) may offer many types of sizing information to CSS, or none 
	at all.  This section defines generically the size negotiation model between 
	the object and the CSS layout algorithms.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="sizing-terms">
Object-Sizing Terminology</h3>

	<p>In order to define this handling, we define a few terms, to make it 
	easier to refer to various concepts:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>intrinsic dimensions</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>An object's intrinsic dimensions are its preferred, natural width,
			height, and aspect ratio, if they exist. There can be an <dfn>intrinsic height</dfn> 
			and <dfn>intrinsic width</dfn>, defining a definite rectangle. (Most bitmap 
			images fall into this category.) There can be an <dfn>intrinsic aspect ratio</dfn> 
			defining the relation of the width to the height, but no definite size. 
			(SVG images designed to scale may fall into this category.) There can be 
			just an intrinsic height or width. Or there can be no intrinsic dimensions 
			at all, implying that the object has no preferred size or aspect ratio. 
			(Embedded documents are often assumed to have no intrinsic size, as are 
			CSS gradients, defined in this specification.)</p>

			<p>If an object (such as an icon) has multiple sizes, then the largest 
			size is used. If it has multiple aspect ratios of that size (or of no 
			size), then the aspect ratio closest to the aspect ratio of the 
			<i>default object size</i> is used.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>specified size</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The specified size of an object is given by CSS, such as through the 
		'object-fit' or 'background-size' properties. The specified size can be a 
		definite width and height, a set of constraints, or a combination thereof.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>concrete object size</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The <i>concrete object size</i> is the result of transforming the <i>intrinsic dimensions</i>
		into a concrete size, based on the <i>specified size</i> and the 
		<i>default object size</i>. A <i>concrete object size</i> always has a definite height 
		and width.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>default object size</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The <i>default object size</i> is a rectangle with a definite height and 
			width used to determine the <i>concrete object size</i> when both the 
			<i>intrinsic dimensions</i> and <i>specified size</i> are missing dimensions.  
			It varies based on the context in which that the image is being laid out.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<p>Below are some examples of default object sizing areas:

				<dl>
					<dt>'background-image'</dt>
					<dd>The <i>default object size</i> is the size of the element's
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#background-positioning-area">background
					positioning area</a>. [[CSS3BG]]</dd>

					<dt>'list-style-image'</dt>
					<dd>The <i>default object size</i> is a 1em square. [[!CSS21]]</dd>

					<dt>'border-image'</dt>
					<dd>The <i>default object size</i> is the size of the element's
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#border-image-area">border image area</a>.
					[[CSS3BG]]</dd>

					<dt>'cursor'</dt>
					<dd>The <i>default object size</i> is a UA-defined size that should
					be based on the size of a typical cursor on the UA's operating system.
					[[!CSS21]]</dd>

					<dt>replaced elements</dt>
					<dd>The <i>default object size</i> is a rectangle 300px wide and 150px
					tall. [[!CSS21]]</dd>
				</dl>
				<p class=issue>The only reason these are examples is because the proper 
				place for the normative definitions of default object sizes is in the 
				definitions for the relevant properties.  These are the correct values,
				though.</p>
			</div>
		</dd>
	</dl>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="object-negotiation">
CSS⇋Object Negotiation</h3>

	<p>Objects in CSS are sized and rendered as follows:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>When an image or object is specified in a document, such as through a url() 
		value in a 'background-image' property or a @src attribute on an &lt;img> element, 
		CSS queries the object for its <i>intrinsic dimensions</i>.</li>

		<li>Using the <i>intrinsic dimensions</i> and the <i>specified size</i>, 
		CSS then computes a <i>concrete object size</i> that defines the size and 
		position of the region the object will render in (specified in the 
		following section).</li>

		<li>CSS asks the object to render itself at the <i>concrete object size</i>.  
		CSS does not define how objects render when the <i>concrete object size</i> 
		is different from the object's <i>intrinsic dimensions</i>.  The object may 
		adjust itself to match the <i>concrete object size</i> in some way, or even
		render itself larger or smaller than the <i>concrete object size</i> to 
		satisfy sizing constraints of its own.</li>

		<li>Unless otherwise specified by CSS, the object is then clipped to the
		<i>concrete object size</i>.</li>
	</ol>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="default-sizing">
Concrete Object Size Resolution</h3>

	<p>In the absence of more specific rules, an object's
	<i>intrinsic dimensions</i> are resolved to a <i>concrete object size</i> as 
	follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the <i>specified size</i> is a definite width and height, the 
		<i>concrete object size</i> is given that width and height.</li>

		<li>If the <i>specified size</i> has only a width or height, but not both,
		then the <i>concrete object size</i> is given that specified width or height.
		The other dimension is calculated as follows:

			<ol>
				<li>If the object has an <i>intrinsic aspect ratio</i>, the missing
				dimension of the <i>concrete object size</i> is calculated using the
				<i>intrinsic aspect-ratio</i> and the present dimension.</li>

				<li>Otherwise, if the missing dimension is present in the object's
				<i>intrinsic dimensions</i>, the missing dimension is taken from the
				object's <i>intrinsic dimensions</i>.</li>

				<li>Otherwise, the missing dimension of the <i>concrete object size</i>
				is taken from the <i>default object size</i>.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

		<li>If the <i>specified size</i> has neither a definite width nor height, and 
		has no additional contraints, the dimensions of the <i>concrete object size</i>
		are calculated as follows:

			<ol>
				<li>If the object has only an <i>intrinsic aspect ratio</i>, the 
				<i>concrete object size</i> must have that aspect ratio, and additionally 
				be as large as possible without either its height or width exceeding 
				the height or width of the <i>default object size</i>.  Otherwise, 
				the width and height of the <i>concrete object size</i> is the same
				as the object's <i>intrinsic width</i> and <i>intrinsic height</i>,
				if they exist.</li>

				<li>If the <i>concrete object size</i> is still missing a width or height,
				and the object has an <i>intrinsic aspect ratio</i>, the missing dimension
				is calculated from the present dimension and the <i>intrinsic aspect ratio</i>.
				Otherwise, the missing dimensions is taken from the <i>default object size</i>.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the <i>specified size</i> has additional constraints, the 
	<i>concrete object size</i> must be sized to satisfy those constraints.
	For example, the 'min-width', 'min-height', 'max-width', and 'max-height'
	properties specify slightly more complex handling for sizing replaced
	elements, and ''background-repeat: round'' can further adjust
	the size calculated by 'background-size' so that the image fits a whole 
	number of times into the background positioning area.</p>

	<p>The 'object-fit' property specifies how the contents of a replaced element

	It also enables scaling a replaced element's contents up to a specified maximum

	displayed.   See the 'object-position' property for positioning the object 
	with respect to the element's box.</p>

	the object as information about the size of the visible canvas.  How to then
	draw into that size is up to the image format.  In particular, raster images
	always scale to the given size, while SVG uses the given size as the size of
	the "SVG Viewport" (a term defined by SVG) and then uses the values of several
	attributes on the root &lt;svg> element to determine how to draw itself.</p>

<h3 id="image-resolution">
Overriding Image Resolutions: the 'image-resolution' property</h3>

	<p>The <i>image resolution</i> is defined as the number of image
	pixels per unit length, e.g., pixels per inch. Some image formats can
	record information about the resolution of images. This information
	can be helpful when determining the actual size of the image in the
	formatting process. However, the information can also be wrong, in
	which case it should be ignored. By default, CSS assumes a resolution
	of one image pixel per CSS ''px'' unit; however, the 'image-resolution'
	property allows using some other resolution.

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>image-resolution</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>[from-image || &lt;resolution>] snap?
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>1dppx

	</table>

	<p>The 'image-resolution' property specifies the resolution of all images used
	in or on the element: images in content (e.g. replaced elements and generated 
	content), background images, list markers, etc.  Values have the following 
	meanings:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>from-image</dt>
		<dd>The image must be rendered at the image's native resolution.  If the image does not have a native resolution or the UA cannot determine it, the image must instead be rendered at the specified resolution (see the following value).  If a resolution is not specified, the image must be rendered at ''1dppx'' (the default resolution).</dd>

		<dt>&lt;resolution></dt>
		<dd>If the "from-image" keyword is not specified, or it is specified and the native resolution cannot be determined, the image must be rendered at the specified resolution.</dd>

		<dt>snap</dt>
		<dd>If the "snap" keyword is provided, and the specified resolution is such that one image pixel would be larger than one device pixel, the image must be rendered at the specified resolution, rounded to the nearest value that would map one image pixel to an integer number of device pixels.  Otherwise, the image must be rendered at the specified resolution, rounded to the nearest value that would map an integer number of image pixels to one device pixel.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>This property must have no effect on vector images, as vector images
	do not have a concept of "resolution".</p>

	<p class='note'>Note that for all images other than the contents of replaced
	elements, the ''image()'' function may be used to override the resolution set
	here.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>This rule specifies that the UA should use the image resolution
		found in the image itself, falling back to 1 image pixel per CSS
		''px'' unit.</p>

		<pre class=css>img { image-resolution: from-image }</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Using this rule, the image resolution is set to 300dpi and the
		resolution in the image, if any, is ignored.</p>

		<pre>img { image-resolution: 300dpi }</pre>

		<p>This rule, on the other hand, if used when the screen's resolution is 96dpi, would instead render the image at 288dpi (so that 3 image pixels map to 1 device pixel):</p>

		<pre>img { image-resolution: 300dpi snap; }
	</div>


	<div class="example">
		<p>These rules both specify that the UA should use the image resolution
		found in the image itself. If the image has no resolution, the
		resolution is set to 300dpi.</p>

	  <pre>
img { image-resolution: from-image 300dpi }
img { image-resolution: 300dpi from-image }
	  </pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="image-orientation">
Orienting an Image on the Page: the 'image-orientation' property</h3>

	<p>Images from camera phones, digital cameras or scanners may be encoded sideways.
	For example, the first row of image data may represent the leftmost or
	rightmost column of image pixels. Furthermore, often such devices have limited
	resources, and do not have the capability to rotate the image into an upright
	orientation. However, this type of device may have internal knowledge or can
	accept input from its user as to the rotational correction to perform.</p>

	<p>The image-orientation property provides a way to specify an "out-of-band"
	rotation to be applied to image source data. This facility is not intended to
	specify layout transformations such as arbitrary rotation or flipping the image
	in the horizontal or vertical direction. It is not needed to correctly orient
	an image when printing in landscape versus portrait orientation, as that
	rotation is done as part of layout. It should only be used to correct
	incorrectly-oriented images.</p>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>image-orientation</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;angle>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>0deg
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>images
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value, rounded and normalized (see text)
	</table>

	<p>'image-orientation' specifies an orthogonal rotation to be applied to an image
	before it is laid out. CSS layout processing applies to the image <em>after</em>
	rotation. This implies, for example:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The intrinsic height and width are derived from the rotated rather than the
		original image dimensions;</li>

		<li>The height (width) property applies to the vertical (horizontal) dimension
		of the image, <em>after</em> rotation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Positive values cause the image to be rotated to the right (in a clockwise
	direction), while negative values cause a rotation to the left.  The computed
	value of the property is calculated by rounding the specified angle to the 
	nearest quarter-turn (90deg, 100grad, .25turn, etc.), rounding away from 0 
	(that is, 45deg is rounded	to 90deg, while -45deg is rounded to -90deg), then
	moduloing the value by 1 turn (360deg, 400grad, etc.).</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>The following example rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise:</p>

		<pre>
img.ninety     { image-orientation: 90deg }
...
&lt;img class="ninety" src=... />
		</pre>

		<p>The same effect could be achieved with, for example, an angle of -270deg
		or 450deg.</p>
	</div>
