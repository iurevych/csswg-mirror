	<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>The draft describes a CSS box model optimized for interface design.
	It provides an additional layout system alongside the ones already in
	CSS.  [[!CSS21]]  In this new box model, the children of a box are
	laid out either horizontally or vertically, and unused space can be
	assigned to a particular child or distributed among the children by
	assignment of "flex" to the children that should expand.
	Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside
	horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  This
	model is based on the box model in the XUL user-interface language
	used for the user interface of many Mozilla-based applications
	(such as Firefox).</p>

<div>
	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined three layout modes, algorithms which determine the size and 
	position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor 
	boxes: normal layout, designed for laying out documents and simple applications,
	table layout, designed for laying out information in a tabular format, and 
	positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard 
	for other elements in the document. This module introduces a new layout mode, 
	flexbox layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and 
	webpages.</p>

	<p>In CSS, flexboxes may be created by setting the 'display' property. A block-level 
	flexbox can be specified with a value of ''flexbox'' and an inline flexbox can be 
	specified using a value of ''inline-flexbox''.  A block-level flexbox placed inside
	a block level element is positioned and sized as if it were any other block. 
	An inline-level flexbox placed inside another element is positioned and sized 
	like an inline-block.</p>

	<p class=issue>It's expected that the 'display' property will be split into 
	'display-inside' and 'display-outside' subproperties to specify, respectively,
	how elements layout themselves and their children, and how they are laid out by
	their parents.  Once this happens, we can cut this down to merely
	''display-inside:flexbox'', and let people set 'display-outside' to ''block'' or
	''inline'' as they wish, or even ''table-cell''.</p>

	<p>Inline children of a flexbox are wrapped in anonymous blocks. All other children
	are block-level.  These anonymous blocks or block-level boxes are referred to as
	''flexbox children'' in this specification.</p>

	<p>Flexbox children may specify their width and height using the 'width' and 
	'height' properties. The width and height of replaced elements is computed as with
	replaced elements in inline contexts. Otherwise, if the width is set to ''auto'', then the
	used value is the intrinsic size, which may be calculated using a shrink-to-fit algorithm,
	as with inline-block elements, i.e., it will be given the minimum amount of space required
	to lay out the element without unnecessary line breaks. Similarly, if the height is set to
	''auto'', then the used value in a similar manner.</p>

	<p>An unnested flexbox placed inside an enclosing block will obey all the
	usual sizing rules of the block. For example, setting the width of an unnested flexbox to
	100% ensures that the flexbox is the maximum width permitted by the enclosing block
	(ignoring any margins, border and padding on that box).</p>

	<p>The difference between flexboxes and blocks is in how the children of the
	element are laid out. Flexbox children are all block-level (inline-level
	contents get wrapped in anonymous blocks).
	These blocks then get stacked in the direction specified by the 'flex-direction'
	property and order specified by the 'flex-order' property.  They are aligned
	within the box according to their margins and the 'flex-align' property.  The 
	flexbox children may then flex or be distributed as specified by their margins,
	the 'flex' property, and the 'flex-pack' property.</p>
	</p><p>

	<p>The 'float' and 'clear' properties do not apply to flexbox children, so the
	used value of these properties is ''none''.  Similarly, none of the properties 
	defined in the CSS Multicol module apply to flexboxes or flexbox children, so 
	the used value of all such properties is the initial value.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example:</p>

		<pre class=html>
&lt;p style="width: 400px; display: flexbox;">
	&lt;button style="width: 200px;">Child 1&lt;/button>
	&lt;button style="width: 100px;">Child 2&lt;/button>
&lt;/p>
		</pre>

		<p>In this example, the first button is 200 pixels wide and the second button is
		100 pixels wide. As the flexbox is 400 pixels wide, there is extra space left over
		which is placed after the two buttons but inside the flexbox. The placement of this
		extra space may be modified using the various flex properties described in the next
		sections. Neither the height of the buttons nor the height of the flexbox are specified,
		so the height is computed intrinsically from the content. In this case, the buttons
		will be the height needed to display the label and button border, and the flexbox will
		also be this height plus any margins around the buttons.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Elements within a box may use the 'overflow' property
	to control whether a scrolling mechanism appears when the children of a box overflow.
	A scrolling mechanism may be displayed when flexible elements are reduced below their minimum
	intrinsic size when the overflow property is set to ''auto'' or ''scroll''.
	If 'overflow' is ''hidden'', the element will be clipped instead. <em>Note
	that the initial value is ''visible'', which is
	typically not the preferred effect in user interfaces.</em></p>

	<h2 id=display-flexbox>New values for 'display' property</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:
				<td>display
			<tr>
				<th>New value:
				<td>flexbox
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>You can declare that an element is a flexbox, and thus should use flexbox 
	layout, by setting the 'display' property on the element to the value 
	''flexbox''.</p>

	<p>All children of a flexbox must be block-level or atomic inline-level 
	elements.  Contiguous runs of non-replaced inline elements are wrapped in an 
	anonymous block-level box.  Out-of-flow elements (such as absolutely 
	positioned elements - floats are also out-of-flow but can't exist as flexbox 
    children) leave behind a "placeholder" in their original source 
	location which is treated like a non-replaced inline element for the purpose of 
	this wrapping.  (This can, for example, create an empty flexbox child, if all 
	the children are block-level elements and one is absolutely positioned.)  It is 
	recommended that authors avoid putting in elements which are auto-wrapped with 
	anonymous boxes, as the anonymous boxes cannot be targetted and controlled with 
	the various flexbox properties defined in later sections.</p>

	<p>A flexbox child creates a new BFC.  The margins of a flexbox child 
	do not collapse with any other margin.</p>

	<p>Setting ''display:flexbox'' on an element forces it to use a new layout 
	algorithm, and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of 
	"normal" flow don't make sense in a flexbox context.  In particular:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module compute to their initial 
		values on a flexbox ('break-before', 'break-inside', and 'break-after' are still 
		valid on a flexbox).</li>
		<li>'float' and 'clear' compute to their initial values on a flexbox child</li>
		<li class=issue>[Others?]</li>
	</ul>
</div>

	<h2 id=flex-direction>Flexbox Direction: the 'flex-direction' property</h2>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:
				<td><dfn>flex-direction</dfn>
			<tr>
				<th>Values:
				<td>lr | rl | tb | bt | inline | inline-reverse | block | block-reverse
			<tr>
				<th>Initial:
				<td>inline
			<tr>
				<th>Applies To:
				<td>flexboxes
			<tr>
				<th>Inherited:
				<td>no
			<tr>
				<th>Computed Value:
				<td>See text
			<tr>
				<th>Media:
				<td>visual
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>The 'flexbox-direction' property specifies how flexbox children 
	are placed on each line of the flexbox.  A value of ''lr'' means that 
	the first flexbox child is placed against the left edge of the flexbox, with 
	later children placed immediately to the right of the preceding flexbox child.  
	A value of ''rl'' is the same, but with the initial flexbox child 
	placed against the right edge of the flexbox and later children placed to the 
	left.  Both of these values mean that the flexbox is a <dfn>horizontal 
	flexbox</dfn>.  A value of ''tb'' means that the first flexbox 
	child is placed against the top edge of the flexbox, with later children placed 
	immediately below it, while ''bt'' means the first child is placed 
	against the bottom edge of the flexbox, with later children placed immediately 
	above it.  Both of these values mean that the flexbox is a <dfn>vertical 
	flexbox</dfn>.</p>

	<p>A value of ''inline'' computes to one of ''lr'', ''rl'', ''tb'', or ''bt'', 
	depending on the direction and block-flow of the flexbox: if the start side of
	the flexbox is the left side, ''inline'' must compute to ''lr''; similarly, if
	the start side of the flexbox is the right, top, or bottom side, ''inline''
	must compute to ''rl'', ''tb'', or ''bt'' respectively.  ''inline-reverse'',
	''block'', and ''block-reverse'' determine their computed value identically to
	''inline'', but use the location of the end side, before side, and after side
	of the flexbox, respectively.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p>A vertical flexbox can be used to emulate the functionality of HTML's
		''&lt;center>'' element:</p>
		<pre>
&lt;div>
	&lt;span>foo foo foo foo&lt;/span>
	&lt;span>bar bar&lt;br>bar bar&lt;/span>
	&lt;span>foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
&lt;style>
	div {
		display: flexbox;
		flex-direction: tb;
		width: 200px;
	}
	span {
		margin: 0 auto;
	}
&lt;/style>
		</pre>
		<p><img alt="" src="images/basic-vertical-flexbox.png"></p>
	</div>

	<p>In the rest of this specification, the direction in which new flexbox children
	are laid out will be referred to as the <dfn>layout direction</dfn> (if a
	precise direction is required) or the <dfn>layout axis</dfn> (if only the axis
	orientiation is required).</p>

	<p>The axis perpendicular to the ''layout axis'' will be refered to as the
	<dfn>transverse axis</dfn>, with the <dfn>transverse direction</dfn> being
	either a line extending from the ''before'' side of the flexbox to the ''after''
	side, or from the ''start'' side of the flexbox to the ''end'' side, whichever
	would produce a direction parallel to the ''transverse axis''.</p>

	<p>Similarly, the <dfn>layout size</dfn> is the width of the flexbox child in
	a horizontal flexbox, or the height in a vertical flexbox.  The <dfn>transverse size</dfn>
	is the height of the flexbox child in a horizontal flexbox, or the width in a
	vertical flexbox.</p>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<div>
	<h2 id=flex-order>Display Order: the 'flex-order' property</h2>

	<p>Flexbox children are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order
	as they appear in the source document.  The 'flex-order' property may be used
	to change this ordering.</p>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-order</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;integer>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>1
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>flexbox children</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
	</table>

	<p class=issue>Maybe name this 'flex-index' instead, to be consistent with 'z-index'.</p>

	<p>Flexbox children may be assigned to ordinal groups using the 'flex-order'
	property.  This property is an integer with an initial value of 1.</p>

	<p>Ordinal groups control the order in which flexbox children appear.  A flexbox
	will lay out its children starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and
	going up.  Elements with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they
	appear in the source document.

	<div class=example>
		<p>This example shows how ordinal groups might be used.</p>
		<pre><code>
	div { display: flexbox; }
	#span1 { flex-order: 2; }
	#span3 { flex-order: 2; }
	#span4 { flex-order: 1; }

	&lt;div>
		&lt;span id="span1">span1&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span2">span2&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span3">span3&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span4">span4&lt;/span>
	&lt;/div></code></pre>

		<p>The first ordinal group, 1, contains span2 and span4. As span2 does not 
		specify an ordinal group, it will default to 1. The elements will be displayed 
		in document order, so span2 will be displayed before span4. The second ordinal 
		group, 2, contains the remaining two spans. The resulting display order will 
		be:</p>

		<pre><code>span2 span4 span1 span3</code></pre>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<h2 id=flex>Flexibility: the 'flex' property</h2>
	
	<p>Each flexbox child may be made either ''flexible'' or ''inflexible''.  Flexible
	elements may grow when the flexbox has extra space available after the size of
	all the flexbox children have been computed, or shrink if the combined size
	of all the flexbox children would cause the flexbox to overflow.  Inflexible
	elements do not change size, even when there it too much or too little space
	left over in the flexbox.</p>

	<p>When figuring out how large a flexible flexbox child is, CSS starts with 
	the flexbox child's <dfn>preferred size</dfn>, which is simply the size specified
	in the 'width' or 'height' property.  It then grows or shrinks that size based
	on the available free space and the flexbox child's relative flexibility.</p>

	<p>The flexibility defined in this section only affects the size of flexbox child
	in the ''layout axis''. (That is, it only affects the width of a flexbox child
	in a horizontal flexbox, or the height in a vertical flexbox.)</p>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-grow</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;number>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>0.0
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>flexbox children
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-shrink</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:

		<tr>
			<th>Media:

	</table>

	<p>An element is <dfn>flexible</dfn> when the 'flex-grow' or 'flex-shrink' property is 
	non-zero.  These properties are floating point values representing the flexibility
	of the flexbox child when the flexbox children are too small or too large, respectively,
	for the flexbox.  When there is extra space left over in a flexbox, the flexible
	elements with a non-zero 'flex-grow' are expanded to fill that space.  When a
	flexbox's contents would overflow the flexbox, the flexible elements with a 
	non-zero 'flex-shrink' are shrunk to keep the contents from overflowing.</p>

	<p>All flexibility is relative.  For example, a flexbox child with a 'flex-grow'
	of 2 is twice as flexible (and thus will absorb twice as much free space) as
	a flexbox child with a 'flex-grow' of 1.</p>

	<p>Both 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink' must be non-negative.  A negative value
	for either property is a syntax error.</p>

	<p>The precise details of how flexibility is treated are defined in a later
	section of this specification.  Generally, flexbox children compute their 
	''preferred size'' in the ''layout axis'', which is then summed between all 
	the flexbox children	and subtracted from the size of the flexbox in the 
	''layout axis''.  If the resultant value is positive, there is free space left
	over, and it is apportioned out to each flexbox child relative to their 'flex-grow'
	value, so that their actual size is their ''preferred size'' plus their portion
	of the free space.  If the resultant value is negative, the flexbox's contents
	would overflow, and so each flexbox child has its size reduced relative to its
	'flex-shrink' value so that the flexbox's contents fit in the flexbox without
	overflowing.</p>

	<p>Margins and paddings can take up the free space as well.  If a margin or 
	padding in the ''layout axis'' is ''auto'', they'll take up free space as if
	they had a flexibility of 1 and started from a size of 0.  Because their size
	starts at 0, they don't participate in shrinking calculations.

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<th><dfn>flex</dfn>
		<tr>
			<tr>Value:
			<td>&lt;number> &lt;number>?

	</table>

	<p>The 'flex' property is a shorthand that can set both 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink'
	at the same time.  It accepts one or two numbers, which must be non-negative.
	Negative numbers are a syntax error.</p>

	<p>If a single number is given, both 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink' are set to
	that value.  If two numbers are given, 'flex-grow' is set to the first value
	and 'flex-shrink' is set to the second.</p>

If the size in the layout axis is computed first, then 'auto' resolves as 'fit-content'.

If the size in the layout axis is computed second, then resolve the size in the

-->
	<div class=issue>
		<p>Somewhat concerned here.  The way it works right now is that 'width'
		sets the preferred width, and 'flex' determines how the preferred width
		changes in response to free space.</p>
		<p>Many people seem to find this unintuitive, though.  We can prevent this
		from being a problem in common cases by, frex, making ''width:auto'' give
		a preferred width of ''min-content'', but should we solve this more directly?
		It appears that forcing absolute flex through setting "width:0" is also
		unintuitive.</p>
		<p>"Fixing" this would probably involve using flex units or perhaps a flex() 
		function in 'width' and 'height', so that you specify the flexibility and
		the preferred width at the same time, in the seemingly-logical place: the
		'width' property.</p>

	<p>After resolving 
	<P>The <CODE>flex-pack</CODE> property specifies what to do with leftover free 
	space if there are no flexible widths or margins, or if all flexible widths have 
	grown to their maximum size and there is still space left over.</P>
	<P>The <CODE>start</CODE> value specifies that flexbox children will be packed 
	toward the start of the flexbox (this is not necessarily the 'start' logical 
	edge - it's the edge of the flexbox that flexbox children are first placed 
	against).  That is, any leftover free space must be placed at the end of the 
	flexbox.</P>
	<P>Similarly, the <CODE>end</CODE> value specifies that flexbox children will be 
	packed toward the end of the flexbox (same caveat as above applies).  That is, 
	leftover free space is placed at the start of the flexbox.</P>
	<P>The <CODE>center</CODE> value specifies that flexbox children will be placed

	<P>The <CODE>justify</CODE> value specifies that flexbox children will be spaced 
	evenly in the flexbox; if there are N flexbox children, leftover free space is 
	split into N-1 equal parts and inserted between each flexbox child.  There is no 
	free space placed at the start or the end of the flexbox; the first and last 
	flexbox child will be flush with the edges of the flexbox.</P>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<p>A flexbox has two axes, which are treated differently by the space distribute algorithm:  the <b>layout axis</b>, which is the axis along which the flexbox grows as you add more children, and the <b>transverse axis</b>, which is the perpendicular axis.</p>

<img alt="In a horizontal flexbox, the layout axis is horizontal, while the transverse axis is vertical.">

<p>The layout axis is more interesting, as there are more places where things can potentially flex.  As such, there are more controls for specifying how to distribute free space in this axis: the 'width' or 'height' property starts things off, modified by the 'flex' property; the 'margin' property gives individual control over spacing between flexbox children; and the 'flex-pack' property gives a more flexbox-global level of control over the between-children spacing.</p>

<p>In general terms, determining where to allocate free space in the layout axis starts by determining just how much free space there is.  All the non-flexible lengths, and the preferred sizes of all the flexible widths or heights, are subtracted from the total width or height of the flexbox.  If a positive length is left over, this is split up among all the flexible lengths according to their flexibility.  Flexible margins automatically have a flexibility of 1, while widths or heights have their flexibility specified by the 'flex-grow' property.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>Three boxes, all with a preferred size of 0, will end up with sizes exactly proportional to their flex-grow values.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>
<div class=example>
	<p>If the three boxes have different preferred sizes, then they'll split the free space proportionately, but their final sizes won't be exactly proportional.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>
<div class=example>
	<p>Margins can also participate in flex calculations.  They have a preferred size of 0, and a flexibility of 1.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>

<p>If none of the lengths are flexible, or if all the flexible widths or height have reached their maximum size (if 'max-width' or 'max-height' properties are in effect), then any leftover space is distributed according to the 'flex-pack' property between the margins of the flexbox children.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>If the flexbox is small enough, then the flexible child can absorb all the space...</p>
	<img>
	<p>...but if it gets large enough, there'll be extra space left over for 'flex-pack' to distribute.</p>
	<img>
</div>

<p>If the original calculation of how much free space was left gave a negative length (that is, if the preferred sizes of all the flexbox children sum to a larger length than the width or height of the flexbox), then flexible margins get set to 0, 'flex-pack' has no effect, and flexbox children with a non-zero 'flex-shrink' value split the responsibility for shrinking between themselves proportionally.  Just like when they grow, their size starts from the preferred size, then combines that with the proportional share of (negative) space.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>When the children are too wide, the shrinkable elements reduce their size to fit...</p>
	<img>
	<p>...but if they all reach their minimum size, they just overflow.</p>

<div>
	<h2 id=flex-align>Alignment: the 'flex-align' property</h2>

	<p>When the size of the flexbox is larger than the size of a child, extra space
	will be available.  The 'margin', 'padding', 'width', 'height',  and 'flex-align' 
	properties specify how a flexbox's children are placed and aligned along the 
	''transverse axis'', and where the extra space, if any, is positioned.</p>

	<p>The amount of extra space may be different for each flexbox child.  For 
	example, if a horizontal flexbox has a height of 200px and contains two children
	at heights of 100px and 150px, there will be 100px of extra space for the first
	child and 50px of extra space for the second child.</p>

	<p>As in the previous section, the precise details of the free space distribution
	are detailed in a later section.  This section merely gives an informative 
	overview of the process.</p>

	<p>The amount of free space is determined by subtracting the ''transverse size''
	of the flexbox child from the size of the flexbox in the same axis.  If either
	of the flexbox child's margins are ''auto'', they take all of the available free
	space, splitting it equally between them if they are both ''auto''.  If neither
	margin is ''auto'', but at least one of the 'padding' values in the ''transverse axis''
	are, then the free space is apportioned to the auto padding, again splitting the
	free space equally if both paddings are ''auto''.  If none of the margins or
	paddings in the ''transverse axis'' are ''auto'', but the 'width' or 'height'
	(whichever is in the ''transverse axis'') are, then that size is given all of
	the free space.  Finally, if nothing in the ''transverse axis'' is ''auto''
	for the flexbox child, the free space is placed after the margin box in the
	''transverse direction''.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p class=issue>Examples go here.</p>
	</div>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-align</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>auto | baseline
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>auto
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>flexbox children
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
	</table>

	<p>The 'flex-align' property changes how free space is distributed in the
	''transverse axis''.  If set to	''auto'', this property does nothing special -
	free space distribution proceeds as outlined above.</p>

	<p>However, if 'flex-align' is set to ''baseline'', then the distribution of
	free space is changed to try and align the baselines of all flexbox children 
	with ''flex-align: baseline''.</p>

	<div class=issue>
		<p>So, I'm not sure what I want to do here.  Possibilities include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Specify how things changes the resolution of auto margin/padding/height</li>
			<li>Move this property up onto the flexbox, where it makes <em>everyone</em>
			baseline-align no matter what, with some switches to determine whether
			the flexbox children stretch or shrink as well.</li>
			<li>Magic?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I think I like #2.  #1 seems complex and tricky.  #3 is more difficult
		unless I become a wizard, which isn't in my career plan at the moment.</p>
		<p>I just need more use-case data on exactly what we need baseline alignment
		for.</p>

  <h2 id="inlinesAndBlocks">Relationship to Inlines and blocks</h2>
	<div class=issue>
		<p>This section seems necessary, but not the precise way it's written.  I
		need to identify precisely what data needs to be exposed both by the containing
		layout model (for the flexbox to use) and by the flexbox (for the containing
		layout model to use), and then write that up.  Then the other layout models
		we produce can re-use the same template.</p>
	</div>

  <p>
   A box placed in a block is considered a block level element and will be positioned
   and sized according to the rules for CSS 2.1 (section 10.3 for widths). Specifically,
   the following equation applies for calculating the width:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + scrollbar width (if any) = width of containing block
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All children of 'box' elements are block-level. If inline-level elements are nested
     inside boxes, they get wrapped in an anonymous block which then takes part in the
     box layout.

  </p><p>
     If the width of a child of a flexible box is computed as 'auto', then the used value
     is the shrink-to-fit width. This calculation is done similarly to how the width of
     a floating element is determined. Otherwise if the width has a computed value,
     then that value is used as the width.
  </p><p>

     In a horizontally oriented box, the flexibility is then applied which may increase
     or decrease the used width. In a vertically oriented box, the position and size
     of the child may be adjusted by the value of the container's
     <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property.
  </p><p>

     The <span class="property">'min-width'</span>, <span class="property">'min-height'</span>,
     <span class="property">'max-width'</span>, and <span class="property">'max-height'</span>
     CSS properties act the same on boxes as on blocks.
  </p><p>

     The height of a child of a flexible box is determined in the same manner as specified
     in the CSS specification. The used height may further be adjusted by the container's
     <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property in a horizontally
     oriented box, or the flexibility in a vertically oriented box.
  </p><p>

     Note that it is possible for a horizontally oriented box that the height of a
     flexible child containing an inline descendant will change when the flexibility is
     applied. Similarly, in a vertically oriented box, the height of a child may change
     based on the <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property of the
     box.
