<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This module specifies the text layout model in CSS and the properties
    that control it. It covers bidirectionality and vertical text.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>This module defines support for various international writing directions,
    such as left-to-right (e.g., Latin scripts), right-to-left (e.g., Hebrew
    or Arabic), bidirectional (e.g., mixing Latin with Arabic) and vertical
    (e.g., Asian scripts).</p>

  <p>Inherently bottom-to-top scripts are not handled in this version. See
    [[UTN22]] for an explanation of relevant issues.</p>

<h2 id="text-flow">Writing Modes and Terminology</h2>

  <p>A <dfn>writing mode</dfn> is defined in terms of its <dfn>inline
    direction</dfn> and <dfn>block flow direction</dfn>:

  <p>The <dfn>inline direction</dfn> is the primary direction in which
    content is ordered on a line and defines on which sides the "start"
    and "end" of a line are. The 'direction' property specifies the
    inline direction and, together with the 'unicode-bidi' property
    and the inherent directionality of any text content, determines
    the ordering of inline-level content within a line.

  <p>The <dfn>block flow direction</dfn> is the direction in which
    block-level boxes stack  and the direction in which line boxes stack
    within a block container. The 'writing-mode' property determines the
    block flow direction.</p>

  <p>The term "writing mode" is chosen because these characteristics are
    strongly associated with the layout of text.</p>

  <p>Writing systems typically have one or two standard writing modes. Some
    examples are:
  <ul>
    <li>Latin-based systems are typically written using a left-to-right inline
      direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.</li>
    <li>Arabic-based systems are typically written using a right-to-left
      inline direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.
    <li>Mongolian-based systems are typically written using a top-to-bottom
      inline direction with a rightward (left-to-right) block flow direction.</li>
    <li>Han-based systems are commonly written using a left-to-right inline direction
      with a downard (top-to-bottom) block flow direction, <strong>or</strong>
      a top-to-bottom inline direction with a leftward (right-to-left) block
      flow direction. Many magazines and newspapers will mix these two writing
      modes on the same page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <dfn>horizontal writing mode</dfn> is one with horizontal lines of
    text, i.e. a downward or upward block flow. A <dfn>vertical writing
    mode</dfn> is one with vertical lines of text, i.e. a leftward or
    rightward block flow. <span class="note">These terms should not be
    confused with <dfn>vertical block flow</dfn> (which is a downard or
    upward block flow) and <dfn>horizontal block flow</dfn> (which is
    leftward or rightward block flow). To avoid confusion, this
    specification avoids the latter set of terms.</span></p>

  <p>See Unicode Technical Note #22 [[UTN22]]
    (<a href="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/vertical-text/paper">HTML version</a>)
    for a more in-depth introduction to vertical text.

<h2 id="text-direction">Inline Direction and Bidirectionality</h2>

  <p>While the characters in most scripts are written from left to right,
    certain scripts are written from right to left. In some documents,
    in particular those written with the Arabic  or Hebrew script, and in
    some mixed-language contexts, text in a single (visually displayed)
    block may appear with mixed directionality. This phenomenon is called
    <span class="index-def" title="bidirectionality (bidi)"><dfn>bidirectionality</dfn></span>, or
    "bidi" for short.</p>

  <p>The Unicode standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9</a>) defines a complex
    algorithm for determining the proper directionality of text. The
    algorithm consists of an implicit part based on character properties,
    as well as explicit controls for embeddings and overrides. CSS relies
    on this algorithm to achieve proper bidirectional rendering. The <span
    class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span> and <span
    class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> properties allow
    authors to specify how the elements and attributes of a document
    language map to this algorithm.</p>

  <p>User agents that support bidirectional text must apply the Unicode
    bidirectional algorithm to every sequence of inline boxes uninterrupted
    by a forced (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Bidirectional_Character_Types">bidi class B</a>)
    line break or block boundary. This sequence forms the "paragraph" unit
    in the bidirectional algorithm. The paragraph embedding level is set
    according to the value of the 'direction' property of the containing
    block rather than by the heuristic given in steps P2 and P3 of the Unicode
    algorithm.</p>

  <p>Because the directionality of a text depends on the structure and
    semantics of the document, these properties should in most cases be
    used only to map bidi information in the markup to its corresponding
    CSS styles. If a document language provides markup features to control
    bidi, authors and users should use those features and not specify CSS
    rules to override them.</p>

  <p>The HTML 4 specification ([[HTML401]], section 8.2) defines
    bidirectionality behavior for HTML elements. The HTML 4 specification
    also contains more information on bidirectionality issues.</p>

  <p class="note">Because HTML UAs can turn off CSS styling, we advise HTML 
    authors to use the HTML 'dir' attribute and &lt;bdo&gt; element to
    ensure correct bidirectional layout in the absence of a style sheet.</p>  

<h3 id="direction">Specifying Directionality: the 'direction' property</h3>

  <table class="propdef">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Name:</th>
        <td><dfn>direction</dfn></td>
      </tr>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>This property specifies the inline progression of text and elements 
    on a line, and the direction of embeddings and overrides (see
    'unicode-bidi') for the Unicode
    bidirectional algorithm. In addition, it affects the ordering of <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html">table</a> column layout,
    the direction of horizontal <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#overflow">overflow</a>,
    and the default alignment of text within a line, and other things
    that depend on the inline progression direction.</p>

  <p>Values for this property have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><strong>ltr</strong></dt>
   <dd>Left-to-right directionality.</dd>
   <dt><strong>rtl</strong></dt>
   <dd> Right-to-left directionality.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">The 'direction' property has no reordering in inline-level
    elements whose 'unicode-bidi' property's value is ''normal''.</p>

  <p class="note">The 'direction'
     property, when specified for table column elements, is not inherited by
     cells in the column since columns are not the ancestors of the cells in
     the document tree. Thus, CSS cannot easily capture the "dir" attribute
     inheritance rules described in [[HTML401]], section 11.3.2.1.

<h3 id="unicode-bidi">Embeddings and Overrides: the 'uncode-bidi' property</h3>

    <table class="propdef">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Name:</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Value:</th>
          <td>normal | ( embed | isolate ) || ( plaintext | bidi-override )</td>
        </tr>

          <td>normal</td>
        </tr>

          <th>Applies to:</th>
          <td>all elements, but see prose</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
          <td>specified value</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <p>Values for this property have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>normal</strong></dt>
    <dd>The element does not open an additional level of embedding with
      respect to the bidirectional algorithm. For inline-level elements,
      implicit reordering works across element boundaries.</dd>
    <dt><strong>embed</strong></dt>
    <dd>If the element is inline-level, this value
      opens an additional level of embedding with respect to the
      bidirectional algorithm. The direction of this embedding level is
      given by the 'direction'
      property. Inside the element, reordering is done implicitly. This
      corresponds to adding a LRE (U+202A; for 'direction: ltr') or RLE
      (U+202B; for 'direction: rtl') at the start of the element and a PDF
      (U+202C) at the end of the element.</dd>
    <dt><strong>bidi-override</strong></dt>
    <dd>For inline-level elements this creates an override.
      For block-level, table-cell, table-caption, or inline-block elements 
      this creates an override for inline-level descendants not within 
      another block-level, table-cell, table-caption, or inline-block 
      element. This means that inside the element, reordering is strictly in sequence
      according to the <span class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span>
      property; the implicit part of the bidirectional algorithm is
      ignored. This corresponds to adding a LRO (U+202D; for 'direction:
      ltr') or RLO (U+202E; for 'direction: rtl') at the start of the
      element and a PDF (U+202C) at the end of the element.</dd>
    <dt><strong>isolate</strong></dt>
    <dd>For the purposes of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, the
      contents of the element are considered to be inside a separate,
      independent paragraph, and for the purpose of bidi resolution
      in its containing bidi paragraph (if any), the element itself is
      treated as if it were an Object Replacement Character (U+FFFC).
      (If the element is broken across multiple lines, then each box
      of the element is treated as an Object Replacement Character.)</dd>
    <dt><strong>plaintext</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>For the purposes of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, the
      base directionality of each "paragraph" for which the element
      is the containing block element is determined not by the element's
      computed 'direction' as usual, but by following rules P1, P2,
      and P3 of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm. However, if no
      direction-determining character is found in step P2, then the
      value of the 'direction' property is used instead. Note this value
      has no effect on inline elements.
  </dl>

  <p>The final order of characters in each block-level element is the
    same as if the bidi control codes had been added as described above,
    markup had been stripped, and the resulting character sequence had
    been passed to an implementation of the Unicode bidirectional
    algorithm for plain text that produced the same line-breaks as the
    styled text. In this process, non-textual entities such as images are
    treated as neutral characters, unless their <span
    class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> property has a
    value other than 'normal', in which case they are treated as strong
    characters in the <span class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span>
    specified for the element.</p>

  <p>Please note that in order to be able to flow inline boxes in a
    uniform direction (either entirely left-to-right or entirely
    right-to-left), more inline boxes (including anonymous inline boxes)
    may have to be created, and some inline boxes may have to be split up
    and reordered before flowing.</p>

  <p>Because the Unicode algorithm has a limit of 
    <em title="According to unicode 3.0, chapter 3, section 12, definition BD2. 
    Specifically, page 58 here: http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch03.pdf">
    61 levels</em> of embedding, care should be taken not to use <span
    class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> with a value other
    than 'normal' unless appropriate. In particular, a value of 'inherit'
    should be used with extreme caution. However, for elements that are,
    in general, intended to be displayed as blocks, a setting of
    'unicode-bidi: isolate' is preferred to keep the element together in
    case display is changed to inline (see example below).</p>

  <p>The following example shows an XML document with bidirectional
    text. It illustrates an important design principle: document language
    designers should take bidi into account both in the language proper
    (elements and attributes) and in any accompanying style sheets. The
    style sheets should be designed so that bidi rules are separate from
    other style rules, and such rules should not be overridden by other
    style sheets so that the document language's bidi behavior is preserved.</p>

<h3 id="bidi-example">Example of Bidirectional Text</h3>

  <div class="example">
    <p>In this example, lowercase letters stand for inherently left-to-right
      characters and uppercase letters represent inherently right-to-left
      characters. The text stream is shown in logical backing store order.</p>

    <pre class="xml-example"><code class="xml">
&lt;HEBREW&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;HEBREW1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 HEBREW5&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;HEBREW6 &lt;EMPH&gt;HEBREW7&lt;/EMPH&gt; HEBREW8&lt;/PAR&gt;
&lt;/HEBREW&gt;
&lt;ENGLISH&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english9 english10 english11 HEBREW12 HEBREW13&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english14 english15 english16&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english17 &lt;HE-QUO&gt;HEBREW18 english19 HEBREW20&lt;/HE-QUO&gt;&lt;/PAR&gt;
&lt;/ENGLISH&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Since this is arbitrary XML, the style sheet is responsible for
      setting the writing direction. This is the style sheet:</p>

    <pre>
/* Rules for bidi */
HEBREW, HE-QUO  {direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;}
ENGLISH         {direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed;} 

/* Rules for presentation */
HEBREW, ENGLISH, PAR  {display: block;}
EMPH                  {font-weight: bold;}
    </pre>

    <p>The HEBREW element is a block with a right-to-left base direction,
      the ENGLISH element is a block with a left-to-right base
      direction. The PARs are blocks that inherit the base direction from
      their parents. Thus, the first two PARs are read starting at the top
      right, the final three are read starting at the top left.  Please note
      that HEBREW and ENGLISH are chosen as element names for explicitness
      only; in general, element names should convey structure without
      reference to language.</p>

    <p>The EMPH element is inline-level, and since its value for <span
      class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> is 'normal' (the
      initial value), it has no effect on the ordering of the text. The
      HE-QUO element, on the other hand, creates an embedding.</p>

    <p>The formatting of this text might look like this if the line length
      is long:</p>

    <pre class="ascii-art">
               5WERBEH 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH 1WERBEH

                                8WERBEH <b>7WERBEH</b> 6WERBEH

english9 english10 english11 13WERBEH 12WERBEH

english14 english15 english16

english17 20WERBEH english19 18WERBEH
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the HE-QUO embedding causes HEBREW18 to be to the right
      of english19.</p>

    <p>If lines have to be broken, it might be more like this:</p>

    <pre class="ascii-art">
       2WERBEH 1WERBEH
  -EH 4WERBEH english3
                 5WERB

   -EH <b>7WERBEH</b> 6WERBEH
                 8WERB

english9 english10 en-
glish11 12WERBEH
13WERBEH

english14 english15
english16

english17 18WERBEH
20WERBEH english19
    </pre>

    <p>Because HEBREW18 must be read before english19, it is on the line
      above english19. Just breaking the long line from the earlier
      formatting would not have worked. Note also that the first syllable
      from english19 might have fit on the previous line, but hyphenation of
      left-to-right words in a right-to-left context, and vice versa, is
      usually suppressed to avoid having to display a hyphen in the middle
      of a line.</p>

  </div><!-- example -->

<h3 id="bidi-box-model">Box model for inline elements in bidirectional context</h3>
<!-- CSS2.1 8.6 -->
  <p>For each line box, UAs must take the inline boxes generated for each
    element and render the margins, borders and padding in visual order
    (not logical order).

  <p>When the element's 'direction' property is ''ltr'', the left-most
    generated box of the first line box in which the element appears
    has the left margin, left border and left padding, and the right-most
    generated box of the last line box in which the element appears has
    the right padding, right border and right margin.

  <p>When the element's 'direction' property is ''rtl'', the right-most
    generated box of the first line box in which the element appears has
    the right padding, right border and right margin, and the left-most
    generated box of the last line box in which the element appears has
    the left margin, left border and left padding.

  <p>SVG1.1 [[!SVG11]] defines some additional values: ''lr'',
    ''lr-tb'', ''rl'', ''rl-tb'', ''tb'', and ''tb-rl''. These values
    are <em>deprecated</em> in any context except SVG1 documents.
    Implementations that wish to support them in the context of CSS
    must treat these values as follows:

  <table class="data">

    </thead>
    <tbody>

  </table>

  <p class="note">In SVG1.1, these values set the <dfn>inline progression
    direction</dfn>, in other words, the direction the current text position
    advances each time a glyph is added. This is a geometric process that
    happens <em>after</em> bidi reordering, and thus has no effect on the
    interpretation of the 'direction' property (which is independent of
    'writing-mode'). (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#RelationshipWithBiDirectionality">Relationship
    with bidirectionality</a>. [[!SVG11]]) There are varying interpretations
    on whether this process causes "writing-mode: rl" to merely shift the
    text string or reverse the order of all glyphs in the text.</p>

  <p class="issue">See <a href="test-writing-mode-direction.svg">this demo</a>
    to check out your implementation's interpretation! (Note that most
    SVG implementations don't support the 'direction' property, and
    thus your results may be skewed on that account. Examine the red
    line of text: if the numbers are not in reverse order, your
    implementation doesn't support "direction: rtl".)</p>

  <p>When set on the root element, the 'writing-mode' property together
    with the 'direction' property determines the <dfn>principal writing
    mode</dfn> of the document. This writing mode is used, for example,
    to determine the default page progression direction. See [[CSS3PAGE]]

  <p>If an element with a specified 'display' of ''inline'' has a different
    block flow direction than its containing block, its 'display' computes
    to 'inline-block'. [[!CSS21]]

<h3>Box Model in Vertical Writing Modes</h3>

  <p>Box layout in vertical writing modes is exactly analogous to layout in
    the horizontal writing modes.</p>

  <p class="note">The logic for the analogy is clear if you lock
    an arrow representing top-to-bottom block flow to a compass of the four
    directions and rotate it to represent right-to-left and left-to-right
    flow. The analogy is somewhat different for inline layout however:
    inline layout is locked to the arrow representing the direction of
    left-to-right text, which in both right-to-left and left-to-right
    block flows progresses downward.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Calculations that refer to 'width' use 'height' instead, and vice
        versa.</li>
    <li>Calculations that refer to the '*-left' and '*-right' box properties
        (border, margin, padding, outline) use '*-top' and '*-bottom'
        instead, and vice versa.
    <li>In right-to-left block flow '*-right' is analogous to top-to-bottom's
        '*-top'; in left-to-right block flow '*-left' is analogous to
        top-to-bottom's '*-top'.</li>
    <li>Layout effects that depend on the directionality to choose between
        left and right (e.g. overflow, overconstraint resolution, 'start'
        values for 'text-align' and other properties, table column ordering)
        depend instead on the effective physical directionality
        (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) to choose between top and bottom.
        Note that the effective physical directionality can be affected
        by the 'text-orientation' property.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Boxes with Orthogonal Writing Mode

  <p>When an element has a different 'writing-mode' from its
    containing block two cases are possible:
  <em class="issue">These descriptions need work</em>
  <ul>
    <li>The two writing modes are perpendicular to each other. (For
      example, 'tb' and 'lr'). In such cases, <span class="issue">detail
      calculation of width/height and determination of containing block dim</span></li>
    <li>The two writing modes are parallel to each other. (For example,
      'rl' and 'lr').</li>
  </ul>


  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following example, two blocks elements (1 and 3) separated
      by an image (2) are presented in various flow writing modes.</p>

  <p>This property specifies the orientation of characters in a non-native

  <dl>
    <dt>right</dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, grapheme clusters from scripts that
      do not have an intrinsic vertical orientation are rotated 90&deg;
      clockwise from their standard orientation in horizontal text.
      When available, vertical glyph variants and vertical font metrics
      are used to set text that is not rotated.
      <p>This value has no effect in horizontal writing modes.</p>
      <span class="issue">Better name? Need smarter selection of vertical
      glyph variants, e.g. glyphs should be rotated within non-vertical-script
      excerpts.</span>
    <dt>upright</dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, grapheme clusters that do not have an
      intrinsic vertical orientation are rendered upright, i.e. in their
      standard horizontal orientation. Shaping characters are shaped in
      their isolated forms. When available, vertical glyph variants and
      vertical font metrics are used to set the text. The UA should
      synthesize vertical font metrics for grapheme clusters that do not
      have any.
      <p>For the purposes of bidi reordering, this value causes all strong
      RTL characters to be treated as LTR and AN digits to be treated as EN.
      If set on inline elements whose 'unicode-bidi' property is not
      'normal' or 'bidi-override', or on elements that are not inline
      this value causes the used value of 'direction' to be ''ltr''.
  </dl>

  <p>[[!SVG11]] defines 'glyph-orientation-vertical' and 'glyph-orientation-horizontal'
    properties that were intended to control text orientation. These
    properties are <em>deprecated</em> and do not apply to non-SVG elements.
    Implementations that wish to support these properties in conjunction with
    'text-orientation' must introduce an ''auto'' value for 'text-orientation',
    which is set by the UA default style sheet on all
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#TermTextContentElement">SVG
    text content elements</a> and which indicates that the SVG
    'glyph-orientation-vertical' and 'glyph-orientation-horizontal' behavior
    controls the layout of text. In all other contexts the ''auto'' behavior
    is the same as for ''right''.

  <p>This property allows the combination of multiple characters into the
    space of a single character. For text layout purposes, e.g. bidi
    ordering, line-breaking, emphasis marks, text-decoration, etc. the
    resulting composition is treated as a single glyph representing the
    Object Replacement Character U+FFFC. Values have the following
    meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="text-combine:none">none</dfn>
    <dd>No special processing.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-combine:cluster">cluster</dfn>
    <dd>Display the text contents of the element in a single 1em square
      using the Japanese "kumoji" rules. [[JISX4051]] The baseline of
      the composition should be chosen to either match the baseline
      of a typical ideographic character in the element's font, or to
      center the composition between the content edges of its parent
      inline box.
      <span class="issue">This doesn't appear in the JLReq document.</span>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-combine:upright">upright</dfn>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing mode, attempt to display the text contents
      of the element horizontally within the vertical line box, ideally
      within the space of one ideographic character (1em square), as follows:
    <p>If the UA has compressed glyphs available for the contents of the
      element, then it should use those glyphs to attempt sizing the
      contents to 1em square. For example, a single-digit number should
      use a fullwidth glyph, a two digit number should use halfwidth or
      proportional glyphs, a three-digit number use 1/3-em glyphs (if
      available, else halfwidth glyphs), etc. The glyphs are stacked
      horizontally (similar to the contents of an inline-box with a
      horizontal writing mode and a line-height of 1em) and the baseline
      of the resulting composition chosen such that it is centered between
      the content edges of its parent inline box.
    <p>If the length of the element's contents exceeds the element's used
      line-height, then its contents are instead rendered as if
      ''text-combine'' were ''none''. This fallback behavior is also
      triggered if the element contains anything other than text.
    <p>In horizontal mode this value is equivalent to ''none''.

  <p>The sides of a box are designated as follows:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>before side</dt><dd>the side occurring first in the block direction (=top side in horizontal-tb writing-mode)</dd>
    <dt>after side</dt><dd>the side opposite the before side (=bottom side in horizontal-tb writing-mode)</dd>

    <dt>end side</dt><dd>the side opposite the start side (=right side in horizontal-tb writing-mode)</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The dimensions of a box are designated as follows:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>logical width<dt><dd>the dimension in the inline direction
      (=width in horizontal writing-mode; height in vertical writing-mode)</dd>

  <p>The computed value of a logical property affects the computed value of the corresponding physical property, and vice versa.</p>
  <p>For example, if the writing-mode of the element is lr-tb, the computed value of the 'margin-before' overrides the 'margin-top'.</p>
  <p>If both logical and physical properties are specified on the same element, these corresponding properties are treated as same property and then normal cascading rules are applied.</p>
  <p>The writing-mode value of the element is used for the mapping of corresponding properties and therefore must be evaluated first.</p>

<h4 id="logical-value">Logical property values: before, after, start, end</h4>

  <p>Properties that accept physical directional values (top, bottom, left, right), should also accept logical directional values (before, after, start, end). In such case, the logical values are treated as corresponding physical values. The writing-mode value of the element is used for the the mapping of logical into physical values and therefore must be evaluated first.</p>

  <p>The following properties (but not limited to) are applicable to this case:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>'float'</li>
    <li>'clear'</li>
    <li>'text-align'</li>
    <li>'caption-side'</li>
  </ul>


<h3 id="directional-modes">Directional Mode Switch</h3>

  <p class="issue">NOTE: This is only a proposal under discussion.</p>

  <p>User agents that support vertical writing mode must support the <dfn>directional mode</dfn> switch:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>physical directional mode</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The directional terms (e.g., 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', 'width' and 'height') in property definitions are interpreted as physical directions, e.g., the 'top' means physically the top side even in vertical writing modes.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>logical directional mode</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The directional terms (e.g., 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', 'width' and 'height') in property definitions are interpreted as logical directions defined relative to the block-flow direction, e.g., the 'top' means physicallly the right side in the rl block-flow direction.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
  <p>In physical directional mode, authors can use directional terms in their normal meanings.</p>
  
  <p>In logical directional mode, authors can use same properties in both horizontal and vertical writing modes for specifying common styles such as indents, margins between blocks, and block dimensions. Style sheets using vertical writing mode with logical directional mode are compatible with existing user agents, that ignore the 'writing-mode' and get fallback to horizontal writing mode, the common styles are kept.</p>
