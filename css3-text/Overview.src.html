  Introduction</h2>

  <p>[document here]</p>

  <p class="issue">This draft describes features that are specific to certain scripts.
  There is an ongoing discussion about where these features belong: in
  existing CSS properties, in new CSS properties, or perhaps in other
  specifications.

  <p id="grapheme-cluster">A <dfn>grapheme cluster</dfn> is what
    a language user considers to be a character or a basic unit of the
    script. The term is described in detail in the Unicode Technical
    Report: Text Boundaries [[!UAX29]]. This specification uses the
    <em>extended grapheme cluster</em> definition in [[!UAX29]] (not
    the <em>legacy grapheme cluster</em> definition). The UA may further
    tailor the definition as allowed by Unicode. Within this specification,
    the ambiguous term <dfn>character</dfn> is used as a friendlier synonym
    for <i>grapheme cluster</i>.
    See <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#character-properties">Characters and Properties</a>
    for how to determine the Unicode properties of a character.

  <p id="letter">A <dfn>letter</dfn> for the purpose of this specification
    is a <i>character</i> belonging to one of the Letter or Number general
    categories in Unicode. [[!UAX44]]

    <p>This property transforms text for styling purposes.
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>No effects.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:capitalize">''capitalize''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts the first <i>character</i> of each word in titlecase; other characters
          are unaffected.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:uppercase">''uppercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in uppercase.
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:lowercase">''lowercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in lowercase.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-width">''full-width''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in fullwidth form.
          If the character does not have a corresponding fullwidth form,
          it is left as is.
          This value is typically used to typeset Latin characters and digits
          like ideographic characters.
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-size-kana">''full-size-kana''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Converts all small Kana characters to normal Kana.
          This value is typically used for ruby annotation text,
          where all small Kana should be drawn as large Kana.
    </dl>

    <p>The case mapping rules for the character repertoire specified by the
      Unicode Standard can be found on the Unicode Consortium Web site
      [[!UNICODE]]. The UA must use the full case mappings for Unicode
      characters, including any conditional casing rules, as defined in
      Default Case Algorithm section. If (and only if) the content language
      of the element is known, then any applicable language-specific rules
      must be used as well. (See
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>)
      </p>

    <p>The definition of "word" used for ''capitalize'' is UA-dependent;
      [[!UAX29]] is suggested (but not required) for determining such word
      boundaries. Authors should not expect ''capitalize'' to follow
      language-specific titlecasing conventions (such as skipping articles
      in English).
    <!-- www-style notes that UAX29 won't work for 'Tis and similar, so
      the UA might want to use UAX29 to split into words, but skip forward
      past any starting non-letters (as an example of why UAX29 is not ideal) -->

    <p>The definition of fullwidth and halfwidth forms can be found on the
      Unicode consortium web site at [[!UAX11]].
      The mapping to fullwidth form is defined by taking code points with
      the &lt;wide&gt; tag in their Decomposition_Mapping in [[!UAX44]]
      and mapping their decomposition (minus the &lt;wide&gt; tag)
      back to the original code point.</p>

    <p>The mappings for small Kana to normal Kana are defined in
      <a href="#small-kana-map">Small Kana Mappings</a>.</p>

    <p>When multiple values are specified and therefore multiple
      transformations need to be applied, they are applied in the following
      order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>''capitalize'', ''uppercase'', and ''lowercase''</li>
      <li>''fullwidth''</li>
      <li>''fullsize-kana''</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Text transformation happens after <a href="#white-space-rules">white
      space processing</a>, which means that ''full-width'' transforms
      only preserved U+0020 spaces to U+3000.

    <div class="example">
      <p>The following example converts the ASCII characters in abbreviations
        in Japanese to their fullwidth variants so that they lay out and line
        break like ideographs:
      <pre>abbr:lang(ja) { text-transform: fullwidth; }</pre>
    </div>

    <p class="issue">All-caps text sometimes has special typographic considerations.
      For example: Punctuation and number glyphs might be adjusted for the
      higher "center of gravity" (see the
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#case">case</a>
      feature in OpenType). Should we turn that on by default, as they suggest?
      Or spacing might be adjusted for the increased visual weight of the glyphs
      (see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#cpsp">cpsp</a>
      feature in OpenType). Should we turn that on when 'letter-spacing' is ''normal''?</p>
      
    <p>A more complicated problem is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706383.aspx">greek uppercasing rules</a>
      which actually alter the diacritics. How should we handle that?

    <p class="note">A future level of CSS may introduce an ''@text-transform''
      rule similar to ''@counter-style'' from [[CSS3LISTS]] to create mapping
      tables for less common text transforms.

<h2 id="white-space-processing">
  White Space Processing</h2>

  <p>The source text of a document often contains formatting that
    is not relevant to the final rendering: for example, breaking
    the source into segments (lines) for ease of editing or adding
    white space characters such as tabs and spaces to indent the
    source code. CSS white space processing allows the author to
    control interpretation of such formatting: to preserve or
    collapse it away when rendering the document.

  <p id="segment-normalization">
    In the document source, segments can be delimited by carriage
    returns (U+000D), linefeeds (U+000A) or a combination (U+000D U+000A),
    or by some other mechanism, such as the SGML RECORD-START
    and RECORD-END tokens.
    
    If no segmentation rules are specified for the document language,
    each line feed (U+000A), carriage return (U+000D) and CRLF sequence
    (U+000D U+000A) in the text is considered a segment break. (This
    default rule also applies to generated content.)

    In CSS, each such segment break is treated as a single line feed
    character (U+000A).

  <p>White space processing in CSS interprets white space characters
    only for rendering: it has no effect on the underlying document data.

  <p class="note">Note that the document parser may have not only normalized
    segment breaks, but also collapsed other space characters or
    otherwise processed white space according to markup rules. Because CSS
    processing occurs <em>after</em> the parsing stage, it is not possible
    to restore these characters for styling. Therefore, some of the
    behavior specified below can be affected by these limitations and
    may be user agent dependent.</p>

  <p>Control characters (Unicode class Cc) other than tab (U+0009), line feed
    (U+000A), space (U+0020), and the bidi formatting characters (U+202<var>x</var>)
    should be rendered as invisible zero-width characters. UAs may instead treat
    them as visible characters. (Note, however, that this will usually result in
    them being rendered as missing glyphs.)
    <span class="issue">What's the line-breaking behavior? Effects on joining?
    Can we just copy the behavior of some zero-width Unicode character?</span>

    <p>This property determines the measure of the tab character (U+0009)

      line feeds (U+00A0).

    <p>For each inline (including anonymous inlines) within an inline

          &mdash;even one outside the boundary of the inline&mdash;is
          removed.
          However, if removing this space would eliminate a line breaking
          opportunity in the text, that opportunity is still considered
          to exist.</li>
        <li>A collapsible space immediately preceding an element with
          ''consume-before'' is removed. Such removed spaces do not indicate
          a line breaking opportunity in the text.
        <li>Any collapsible spaces after the end of an element with
          ''consume-after'' are removed. Such removed spaces do not indicate
          a line breaking opportunity in the text.

    <li><p>If 'text-space-collapse' is set to
      ''discard'', the first white space character in every white space
      sequence is converted to a zero width non-joiner (U+200C) and
      the rest of the sequence is removed.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>Then, the entire block is rendered. Inlines are laid out, taking bidi
      reordering into account, and wrapping as specified by the
      'text-wrap' property.</p>

    <p>As each line is laid out,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A sequence of collapsible spaces at the beginning of a line is
        removed.
      <li>Each tab is rendered as a horizontal shift that lines up
        the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop.
        Tab stops occur at points that are multiples of the width of a
        space (U+0020) rendered in the block's font from the block's
        starting content edge. How many spaces is given by the 'tab-size'
        property.</li>
      <li>A sequence of collapsible spaces at the end of a line is removed.
      <li>If spaces or tabs at the end of a line are non-collapsible but
         have 'text-wrap' set to 'normal' or 'avoid' the UA may visually
         collapse their character advance widths.
    </ol>

    <p>White space that was not removed during the white space processing
      steps is called <dfn>preserved</dfn> white space.</p>

      Example of bidirectionality with white space collapsing</h4>

      <p>Consider the following markup fragment, taking special note of spaces
        (with varied backgrounds and borders for emphasis and identification):
        </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ltr&gt;A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>&lt;rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>B<span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>&lt;/rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>C&lt;/ltr&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>where the <code>&lt;ltr&gt;</code> element represents a left-to-right
        embedding and the <code>&lt;rtl&gt;</code> element represents a
        right-to-left embedding. If the 'text-space-collapse' property is set
        to ''collapse'', the above processing model would result in the
        following:</p>

      <ul style="line-height:1.3">
        <li>The space before the B (<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the A (<span
          class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>).</li>
        <li>The space before the C (<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the B (<span
          class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This would leave two spaces, one after the A in the left-to-right
        embedding level, and one after the B in the right-to-left embedding
        level. This is then ordered according to the Unicode bidirectional
        algorithm, with the end result being:</p>

      <pre>A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span><span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>BC</pre>

      <p>Note that there are two spaces between A and B, and none between B
        and C. This is best avoided by putting spaces outside the element
        instead of just inside the opening and closing tags and, where
        practical, by relying on implicit bidirectionality instead of explicit
        embedding levels.</p>

      <p class="note">Note that the white space processing rules have already
        removed any tabs and spaces after the line feed before these checks
        take place.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the character immediately before or immediately after the line
          feed is the zero width space character (U+200B), then the line feed
          is removed.
        <li>Otherwise, if the East Asian Width property [[!UAX11]] of both

          and neither side is Hangul,
          then the line feed is removed.
        <li>Otherwise, the line feed is converted to a space (U+0020).

<h2 id="line-breaking">
  Line Breaking and Word Boundaries</h2>

  <p>In most writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a line break occurs
    only at word boundaries. Many writing systems use spaces or
    punctuation to explicitly separate words, and line break opportunities
    can be identified by these characters. Scripts such as Thai, Lao, and
    Khmer, however, do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words.
    Although the zero width space (U+200B) can be used as an explicit word
    delimiter in these scripts, this practice is not common. As a result,
    a lexical resource is needed to correctly identify break points in such
    texts.

  <p>In several other writing systems, (including Chinese, Japanese, Yi,
    and sometimes also Korean) a line break opportunity is based on
    character boundaries, not word boundaries. In these systems a line can break
    anywhere <em>except</em> between certain character combinations.
    Additionally the level of strictness in these restrictions can vary
    with the typesetting style.</p>

  <p>CSS does not fully define where line breaking opportunities occur,
    however some controls are provided to distinguish common variations.

  <p class="note">Further information on line breaking conventions can be
      found in
      [[JLREQ]] and [[JIS4051]] for Japanese,
      [[ZHMARK]] for Chinese, and
      in [[!UAX14]] for all scripts in Unicode.
      <!-- The CSS Working Group notes that although UAX 14 contains a wealth of
      information about line breaking conventions, a literal implementation
      of its algorithm has been found to be inadequate in multiple situations. --></p>

  <p class="issue">Any guidance for appropriate references here would be
    much appreciated.</p>

  <p class="issue">Information on line-breaking in the absence of dictionaries:
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0126.html">for Thai</a>

  <p>Floated and absolutely-positioned elements do not introduce a line
    breaking opportunity. The line breaking behavior of a replaced element
    is equivalent to that of a Latin character.</p>

  <p class="issue">It is not clear whether this section handles Southeast Asian
    scripts well. Additionally, some guidance should be provided on how to
    break or not break Southeast Asian in the absence of a dictionary.</p>

    <p>This property specifies the strictness of line-breaking rules applied

      punctuation. Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The UA determines the set of line-breaking restrictions to use,

      <dt><dfn title="line-break:loose">''loose''</dfn></dt>

    </dl>

    <p>CSS distinguishes between three levels of strictness in the rules for
      implicit line breaking. The precise set of rules in effect for each
      level is up to the UA and should follow language conventions. However,
      this specification does recommend that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''strict'' line breaking and
        allowed in ''normal'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before Japanese small kana
          <li>breaks before the KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK (&#x30FC; U+30FC)
        </ul>
        Additionally, if the language is known to be Chinese or Japanese,
        breaks before hyphens (U+2010, U+2013, U+301C, U+30A0) may be allowed
        in ''normal''.
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''normal'' and ''strict'' line
        breaking and allowed in ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before iteration marks (U+3005, U+303B, U+309D, U+309E, U+30FD, U+30FE)</li>
          <li>breaks between some inseparable characters (U+2025, U+2026)</li>
        </ul>
        If the language is known to be Chinese or Japanese, then additionally
        the following breaks may be allowed in ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before middle dots (U+003A, U+003B, U+30FB, U+FF1A, U+FF1B, U+FF65)</li>
          <li>breaks before dividing punctuation marks (U+0021, U+003F, U+203C, U+2047, U+2048, U+2049, U+FF01, U+FF1F)</li>
          <li>breaks before postfixes (U+0025, U+00A2, U+00B0, U+2030, U+2032, U+2033, U+2103, U+FF05, U+FFE0)</li>
          <li>breaks after prefixes (U+0024, U+00A3, U+00A5, U+20AC, U+2116, U+FF04, U+FFE1, U+FFE5)</li>
        </ul>

    <p>This property specifies line break opportunities within words.
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="word-break:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Break lines according to their usual rules.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="word-break:break-all">''break-all''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Lines may break between any two characters within words.
        Hyphenation is not applied. This option is used mostly in a context where
        the text is predominantly using CJK characters with few non-CJK excerpts
        and it is desired that the text be better distributed on each line.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="word-break:keep-all">''keep-all''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Lines may break only at <a href="#word-separator">word separators</a>
        and other explicit break opportunities. Otherwise this option is
        equivalent to ''normal''.
        This option is mostly used where the presence of word separator
        characters still creates line-breaking opportunities, as in Korean.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words
      due to ''break-all'', the characters must still be shaped as if the
      word were not broken.</p>

<h2 id="hyphenation">Hyphenation</h2>

    <p>Hyphenation allows the controlled splitting of words to improve the
      layout of paragraphs. CSS3 Text does not define the exact rules for
      hyphenation, but defines six properties and an at-rule that influence
      hyphenation.

    <p>Whether hyphenation is applied can controlled with the 'hyphens' property.

    <p>The following author controls are not required to be supported for
      the UA to claim conformance to CSS Text Level 3:
    <ul>
      <li>'hyphenate-limit-zone'
      <li>'hyphenate-limit-chars'
      <li>'hyphenate-limit-lines'
    </ul>

    <p>Nonetheless, UAs are strongly encouraged to optimize their line-breaking
      implementation to choose good break points and appropriate hyphenation
      points.

    <p class="note">These controls are optional because for a low-end
      implementation of hyphenation, they are not critical enough; and for
      a high-end implementation of paragraph breaking (such as in
      T<span style="font-variant: small-caps">e</span>&chi;) they are not
      considered especially useful.</p>

    <p>Hyphenation opportunities are not considered when calculating
      ''min-content'' intrinsic sizes.

    <p>Correct automatic hyphenation requires a hyphenation resource
      appropriate to the language of the text being broken. The UA is
      therefore only required to automatically hyphenate text for which
      the author has declared a language (e.g. via HTML <code>lang</code>
      or XML <code>xml:lang</code>) and for which it has an appropriate
      hyphenation resource.

    <p>When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words
      due to hyphenation, the characters must still be shaped as if the word
      were not broken.</p>

    <p>This property specifies the mode for text wrapping. Possible values:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lines may break at allowed break points, as determined by the
      line-breaking rules in effect. Line breaking behavior defined
      for the WJ, ZW, and GL line-breaking classes in
      [[!UAX14]] must be honored.
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lines may not break; text that does not fit within the block container
      overflows it.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:avoid">''avoid''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Line breaking is suppressed within the element: the UA may only break
      within the element if there are no other valid break points in the
      line. If the text breaks, line-breaking restrictions are honored as for
      'normal'.
    </dl>

    <p>Regardless of the 'text-wrap' value, lines always break at forced breaks:
     for all values, line-breaking behavior defined for the BK, CR, LF, CM
     NL, and SG line breaking classes in [[!UAX14]] must
     be honored.</p>

    <p>When <span class="property">'text-wrap'</span> is set to 'normal' or
      'avoid', UAs that allow breaks at punctuation other than spaces
      should prioritize breakpoints.
      For example, if breaks after slashes have a lower priority than spaces,
      the sequence "check /etc" will never break between the '/' and the 'e'.
      The UA may use the width of the containing block, the text's language,
      and other factors in assigning priorities.
      As long as care is taken to avoid such awkward breaks, allowing breaks at
      appropriate punctuation other than spaces is recommended, as it results
      in more even-looking margins, particularly in narrow measures.</p>

        value and results in a computed value of either 'left' or 'right'.
    </dl>

    <p>If two keywords are given in combination, then the first value specifies
      the alignment of the first line and any line immediately after a forced
      line break; and the second value specifies the alignment of any remaining
      lines.

    <p>A block of text is a stack of
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>.
      In the case of 'start', 'end', 'left', 'right' and 'center', this
      property specifies how the inline-level boxes within each line box align
      with respect to the start and end sides of the line box: alignment is not
      with respect to the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a>
      or containing block.
      
    <p>In the case of 'justify', the UA may stretch or shrink any inline boxes
      by <a href="#text-justify">adjusting</a> their text in addition to
      shifting their positions. (See also 'text-justify', 'letter-spacing', and
      'word-spacing'.)
      If an element's white space is set to be <a href="#collapse">collapsible</a>,
      then the UA is not required to adjust its text for the purpose of
      justification and may instead treat the text as having no expansion
      opportunities. If the UA chooses to adjust the text, then it must ensure
      that tab stops continue to line up as required by the
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#white-space-rules">white
      space processing rules</a>. 

  <h4 id="character-alignment">Details on Character-based Alignment in a Table Column</h4>
  
    <p>When multiple cells in a column have an alignment character specified,
      the alignment character of each such cell in the column is centered along
      a single column-parallel axis and the rest of the text in the column
      shifted accordingly. (Note that the strings do not have to be the same
      for each cell, although they usually are.)

    <p>If the alignment character appears more than once in the text, the first
      instance is used for alignment. If the alignment character does not appear
      in a cell at all, the string is aligned as if the alignment character had
      been inserted at the end of its contents.

    <p>Character-based alignment occurs before table cell width computation so
      that auto width computations can leave enough space for alignment.
      Whether column-spanning cells participate in the alignment prior to
      or after width computation is undefined.
      If width constraints on the cell contents prevent full alignment
      throughout the column, the resulting alignment is undefined.

    <p>A keyword value may be specified in conjunction with the &lt;string&gt;
      value; if it is not given, it defaults to ''right''. This value is used:
    <ul>
      <li>when character-based alignment is applied to boxes that are not table
        cells.
      <li>when the text wraps to multiple lines (at unforced break points).
      <li>when the column is wide enough that the character alignment alone does
        not determine the positions of its character-aligned contents. In this
        case the keyword alignment of the first cell in the column with a
        specified alignment character is used to slide the position of the
        character-aligned contents to match the keyword alignment insofar as
        possible without changing the width of the column.
        For ''center'', the UA may center
        the aligned contents using its extremes, center the alignment axis
        itself (insofar as possible), or optically center the aligned contents
        some other way (such as by taking a weighted average of the extent of
        the cells' contents to either side of the axis).
      <li>when a character-aligned cell spans more than one column. In this
        case the keyword alignment value is used to determine which column's
        axis to align with: the leftmost column for ''left'', the rightmost
        column for ''right'' and ''center'', the startmost column for ''start'',
        the endmost column for ''end''.
    </ul>

    <p>This property selects the justification method used when a line's
      alignment is set to ''justify''. (See 'text-align'.)
      The property applies to block containers, but the UA may (but
      is not required to) also support it on inline elements.
      It takes the following values:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-justify:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The UA determines the justification algorithm to follow, based
          on a balance between performance and adequate presentation quality.
          <p class="note">One possible algorithm is to determine the behavior
          based on the language of the paragraph: the UA can then choose
          appropriate value for the language, like ''inter-ideograph''
          for CJK, or ''inter-word'' for English.
          Another possibility is to use a justification method that is a
          universal compromise for all scripts, e.g. the ''inter-cluster''
          method with block scripts raised to first priority.</p>

        <dd>Justification primarily changes spacing both at word
          separators and between characters in all scripts equally
          (except those in the connected and cursive categories).
          This value is sometimes used in e.g. Japanese.</dd>

        <dd>Justification primarily stretches
          <a href="#cursive-scripts">cursive scripts</a> through the use of
          kashida or other calligraphic elongation.
          This value is <em>optional</em> for conformance to CSS3 Text.
          (UAs that do not support cursive elongation must
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-2010/#partial">treat the value
          as invalid</a>.)
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When justifying text, the user agent takes the remaining space between
      the ends of a line's contents and the edges of its line box, and
      distributes that space throughout its contents so that the contents
      exactly fill the line box. If the 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing'
      property values allow it, the user agent may also distribute negative
      space, putting more content on the line than would otherwise fit under
      normal spacing conditions. The exact justification algorithm is
      UA-dependent; however, CSS provides some general guidelines which should
      be followed when any justification method other than 'auto' is
      specified.</p>

    <p id="expansion-opportunity">CSS defines <dfn>expansion opportunities</dfn>
      as points where the justification algorithm may alter spacing within
      the text. These expansion opportunities fall into priority
      levels as defined by the justification method. Within a line, expansion
      and compression should primarily target the first-priority expansion
      opportunities; lower priority expansion opportunities are adjusted at a
      lower priority as needed.

    <p>Expansion and compression limits are given by the
      <a href="#letter-spacing">letter-spacing</a>
      and <a href="#word-spacing">word-spacing</a> properties.
      How any remaining space is distributed once all expansion opportunities
      reach their limits is up to the UA. If the inline contents of a line
      cannot be stretched to the full width of the line box, then they must be
      aligned as specified by the 'text-align-last' property. (If
      'text-align-last' is ''justify'', then they must be aligned as for
      ''center'' if 'text-justify' is ''distribute'' and as ''start''
      otherwise.)</p>

    <p>The expansion opportunity priorities for values of 'text-justify'
      are given in the table below. Since justification behavior
      varies by writing system, expansion opportunities are organized by
      <a href="#script-groups">script categories</a>.
      An expansion opportunity exists between two <i>letters</i> at a
      priority level when at least one of them belongs to a script category
      at that level and the other does not belong to a higher priority level.
      All scripts in the same priority level must be treated exactly the same.
      Word separators (spaces) and other symbols and punctuation are treated
      specially, see below.

    <p id="auto-justify"><small>* The ''auto'' column defined above is informative; it
      suggests a prioritization that presents a universal compromise among
      justification methods.</small></p>
    <p id="justify-spaces">The <dfn title="spaces-category">spaces</dfn> category represents
      expansion opportunities at <a href="#word-separator">word separators</a>.
      (See <a href="#word-spacing">'word-spacing'</a>.) The UA may treat
      spaces differently than other expansion points in the same priority,
      but must not change their priority with respect to expansion points
      in other priority levels. For example, in Japanese ''inter-ideograph''
      justification (which treats CJK characters at a higher priority than
      Latin characters), word spaces traditionally have a higher priority
      than inter-CJK spacing, and the UA may split the 1st-priority level
      to implement that. However the UA is not allowed to drop spaces to
      the same priority as Latin characters.
    <p id="justify-symbols">The <dfn id="punctuation-symbols">symbols</dfn>
      category represents the expansion opportunities existing at or between
      any pair of characters from the Unicode Symbols (S*) and Punctuation (P*)
      classes and at enabled <a href="#text-autospace">autospace</a> points.
      The default justification priority of these points is given above.
      However, there may be additional rules controlling their justification
      behavior due to typographic tradition. Therefore, the UA may reassign
      specific characters or introduce additional levels of prioritization
      to handle expansion opportunities involving symbols and punctuation.
      For example, there are traditionally no expansion opportunities
      between consecutive EM DASH U+2014, HORIZONTAL BAR U+2015, HORIZONTAL
      ELLIPSIS U+2026, or TWO DOT LEADER U+2025 characters [[JLREQ]]; thus
      a UA may assign these characters to the "never" prioritization level.

    <p id="justify-cursive">For justification of <i>cursive scripts</i>,
      words may be expanded through kashida elongation or other cursive
      expansion processes. Kashida may be applied in discrete units or
      continuously, and the prioritization of kashida points is UA-dependent:
      for example, the UA may apply more at the end of the line. The
      UA should not apply kashida to fonts for which it is inappropriate.
      It may instead rely on other justification methods that lengthen
      or shorten Arabic segments (e.g. by substituting in swash forms or
      optional ligatures). Because elongation rules depend on the typeface
      style, the UA should rely on on the font whenever possible rather
      than inserting kashida based on a font-independent ruleset. The UA
      should limit elongation so that, e.g. in multi-script lines a short
      stretch of Arabic will not be forced to soak up too much of the
      extra space by itself. If the UA does not support cursive elongation,
      then, as with connected scripts, no expansion points exist between
      characters of these scripts.

    <p>The UA may enable or break optional ligatures or use other font
      features such as alternate glyphs or glyph compression to help
      justify the text under any method. This behavior is not controlled by
      this level of CSS.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>3.8 Line Adjustment in [[JLREQ]] gives an example of a set of rules for
        how a text formatter can justify Japanese text.
        It describes rules for cases where the 'text-justify' property is ''inter-ideograph''
        and the 'text-spacing' property does not specify ''no-compress''.</p>
      <p>It produces an effect similar to cases where
        the computed value of 'text-spacing' property does not specify
        ''trim-end'' or ''space-end''.
        If the UA wants to prohibit this behavior,
        rule b. of 3.8.3 should be omitted.</p>
      <p>Note that the rules described in the document specifically target Japanese.
        Therefore they may produce non-optimal results
        when used to justify other languages such as English.
        To make the rules more applicable to other scripts,
        the UA could, for instance,
        omit the rule to compress half-width spaces (rule a. of 3.8.3).</p>

    <p>This property specifies the minimum, maximum, and optimal spacing
      between words. If only one value is specified, then it represents
      the optimal spacing and the minimum and maximum are both 'normal'.
      If two values are specified, then the first represents both the
      optimal spacing and the minimum spacing, and the second represents
      the maximum spacing. If three values are specified, they represent
      the optimum, minimum, and maximum respectively.</p>

    <p>If the value of the optimum or maximum spacing is less than the
      value of the minimum spacing, then its used value is the minimum
      spacing. If the optimum spacing is greater than the maximum spacing
      then its used value is the maximum spacing. (This substitution
      occurs after inheritance.)</p>

     <p>In the absence of justification the optimal spacing must be used.
      The text justification process may alter the spacing
      from its optimum (see the <a href="#text-justify">'text-justify'</a>
      property, above) but must not violate the minimum spacing limit

    <p>UAs may apply letter-spacing to cursive scripts. In this case, UAs

      the cursive connections, it should not apply letter-spacing between

    <p>This property is additive with the 'word-spacing' and 'letter-spacing'
      properties. That is, the amount of spacing contributed by the
      'letter-spacing' setting (if any) is added to the spacing created by
      'text-spacing'. The same applies to 'word-spacing'.

    <p>At element boundaries, the amount of extra spacing introduced
      between characters is determined by and rendered within the innermost
      element that contains the boundary. If the extra spacing is applied
      to a particular glyph, then the spacing is determined by the innermost
      element containing that glyph.

    <p>Support for this property is <em>optional</em>. It is strongly
      recommended for UAs that wish to support CJK typography.</p>

    <p class="issue">It was requested to add a value for doubling the space after
      periods.</p>


<h4 id="fullwidth-collapsing">
Fullwidth Punctuation Collapsing</h4>

    <p>Typically fullwidth characters have glyphs with the same advance width
      as a standard Han character (e.g. 水 U+6C34). However, many fullwidth
      punctuation glyphs only take up part of the fullwidth design space.
      Thus such punctuation are not always set fullwidth. Several values of
      'text-spacing' allow the author to control when such characters are
      set half-width (typically half the width of an ideograph) and when
      they are set full-width.

    <p>In order to set the text as specified, the UA may need to either
      <ul>
        <li>trim (kern) the blank half of the glyphs if they are given
          full-width and must be set half-width, or
        <li>add space to the glyphs if they are given half-width must be set
          full-width.
      </ul>

    <p>Some fonts use proportional glyphs for fullwidth punctuation characters.
      For such proportional glyphs, the given advance width is considered
      simultaneously full-width and half-width: no space is added or removed.

    <p class="note">The advance width of a standard Han character can be
      determined either from font metrics such as the OpenType <code>ideo</code>
      and <code>idtp</code> baselines for the opposite writing mode, or
      by taking the advance width of a Han character such as 水 U+6C34.
      (The opposite writing mode must be used because some fonts are compressed
      so that the characters are not square.) More information on OpenType
      metrics can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/baselinetags.htm#ideoembox">in
      the OpenType spec</a>.
      Note that if 水 U+6C34, 卜 U+535C, and 一 U+4E00 do not all have
      the same advance width, the font has proportional ideographs and the
      fullwidth advance width cannot be reliably determined by measuring
      glyphs.

    <p>Unless 'text-spacing' is set to ''space-adjacent'' or ''none'' (or the
      font has proportional fullwidth punctuation glyphs), the UA
      must collapse the space typically associated with such full width
      glyphs as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Set <i>fullwidth opening punctuation</i> half-width if the previous
        character is a <i>fullwidth opening punctuation</i>, <i>fullwidth middle dot
        punctuation</i>, or ideographic space (U+3000). Else set it full-width.
      <li>Set <i>fullwidth closing punctuation</i> half-width if the next
        character is a <i>fullwidth closing punctuation</i>, <i>fullwidth middle dot
        punctuation</i>, or ideographic space (U+3000). Else set it full-width.
      <li>Set <i>fullwidth closing punctuation</i> followed by <i>fullwidth opening
        punctuation</i> each "3/4-width", i.e. halfway between fullw-width and
        half-width.
    </ul>

    <div class="example">

    <p>Whether fullwidth colon punctuation and fullwidth dot punctuation should
      be considered fullwidth closing punctuation or fullwidth middle dot
      punctuation depends on where in the glyph's box the punctuation is drawn.
      If the punctuation is centered, then it should be considered middle dot
      punctuation. If the punctuation is drawn to one side (left in horizontal
      text, top in vertical text) and the other half is therefore blank then
      the punctuation should be considered closing punctuation and trimmed
      accordingly.</p>

    <p>The UA must classify fullwidth colon punctuation and fullwidth dot
      punctuation under either the fullwidth closing punctuation category or
      the fullwidth middle dot punctuation category as appropriate. The UA
      may rely on language conventions and the writing mode (horizontal
      vs. vertical), and/or font information to determine this categorization.
      The UA may also add additional characters to any category as appropriate.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The following informative table summarizes language conventions for
      classifying fullwidth colon and dot punctuation:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <colgroup class="header"></colgroup>
        <colgroup span=2></colgroup>

<h2 id="edge-effects">
  Edge Effects</h2>

  <p>Edge effects control the indentation of lines with respect to other lines
    in the block ('text-indent') and how content is aligned to the start and
    end edges of a line ('hanging-punctuation', see also 'text-spacing').

  <div class="example">
    <p>Japanese has three common start-edge typesetting schemes, which are
      distinguished by their handling of opening brackets.

    <div class="figure">
      <p><img src="opening-brackets-at-line-head.png"
        width="646" height="360"
        alt="The first scheme aligns opening brackets flush with the indent
             edge on the first line and with the start edge of other lines.
             The second scheme gives the opening bracket its full width, so
             that it is effectively indented half an em from the indent edge
             and from the start edge of other lines.
             The third scheme aligns the opening brackets flush with the
             start edge of lines, but hangs them inside the indent on the
             first line (resulting in an effective half-em indent instead
             of the full em for paragraphs that begin with an opening bracket).">
      <p class="caption">Positioning of opening brackets at line head [[JLREQ]]</p>
    </div>

    <p>Assuming a UA style sheet of <code>p { margin: 1em 0; }</code>, CSS can
      achieve the Japanese typesetting styles with the following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>Brackets flush with indent, flush with other lines (first scheme):
        <pre>p { /* Flush alignment */
<!--   -->  margin: 0;
<!--   -->  text-indent: 1em;
<!--   -->  text-spacing: trim-start;
<!--   -->}</pre>
      <li>Brackets preserve fullwidth spacing on all lines (second scheme):
        <pre>p { /* Fullwidth alignment */
<!--   -->  margin: 0;
<!--   -->  text-indent: 1em;
<!--   -->  text-spacing: normal;
<!--   -->}</pre>
      <li>Brackets hang in indent, flush with other lines (third scheme):
        <pre>p { /* Hanging alignment */
<!--   -->  margin: 0;
<!--   -->  text-indent: 1em;
<!--   -->  text-spacing: trim-start;
<!--   -->  hanging-punctuation: first;

    <p>This property specifies the indentation applied to lines of inline
      content in a block. The indent is treated as a margin applied to
      the start edge of the line box. Unless otherwise specified via the
      ''each-line'' and/or ''hanging'' keywords, only lines that are the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-line-pseudo">first
      formatted line</a> of an element are affected. For example, the first line of
      an anonymous block box is only affected if it is the first child
      of its parent element.

    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>''&lt;length&gt;''</dt>
      <dd>Gives the amount of the indent as an absolute length.</dd>
      <dt>''&lt;percentage&gt;''</dt>
      <dd>Gives the amount of the indent as a percentage of the containing
        block's logical width.</dd>
      <dt><dfn>''each-line''</dfn>
      <dd>Indentation affects the first line of the block container as
        well as each line after a forced line break, but does not affect
        lines after a text wrap break.
      <dt><dfn>''hanging''</dfn>
      <dd>Inverts which lines are affected.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="example">
      <p>If 'text-align' is 'start' and 'text-indent' is '5em' in

    </div>

    <p class="note">Note that since the 'text-indent' property inherits,
      when specified on a block element, it will affect descendant
      inline-block elements.
      For this reason, it is often wise to specify 'text-indent: 0' on
      elements that are specified 'display: inline-block'.</p>

    <p>This property determines whether a punctuation mark, if one is present,
      may be placed outside the line box (or in the indent) at the start
      or at the end of a line of text.

    <p class="note">Note that if there is not sufficient padding on the
      block container, hanging punctuation can trigger overflow.</p>

    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="hanging-punctuation:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>No characters can hang.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="hanging-punctuation:first">''first''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An opening bracket or quote at the start of the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-line-pseudo">first
          formatted line</a> of an element hangs.
          This applies to all characters in the Unicode categories Ps, Pf, Pi.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="hanging-punctuation:force-end">''force-end''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A stop or comma at the end of a line hangs.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="hanging-punctuation:allow-end">''allow-end''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A stop or comma at the end of a line hangs if it
          does not otherwise fit prior to justification.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When a punctuation mark hangs, it is not considered when measuring
      the line's contents for fit, alignment, or justification.
      Depending on the line's alignment, this can push the mark outside the
      line box. At most one punctuation character may hang outside each edge
      of the line.

    <p class="note">A hanging punctuation mark is still enclosed inside
      its inline box and participates in text justification: its character
      advance width is just not measured when determining how much content
      fits on the line, how much the line's contents need to be expanded
      or compressed for justification, or how to position the content
      within the line box for text alignment.

    <p>Non-zero start and end borders or padding on an inline box are not
      allowed to hang. This can sometimes prevent a hangable punctuation mark
      from hanging: for example, a period at the end of an inline box with
      end padding cannot hang outside the end edge of a line.</p>

    <p>Stops and commas allowed to hang include:
        U+002C COMMA,
        U+002E FULL STOP,
        U+060C ARABIC COMMA,
        U+06D4 ARABIC FULL STOP,
        U+3001 IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA,
        U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP,
        U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA,
        U+FF0E FULLWIDTH FULL STOP,
        U+FE50 SMALL COMMA,
        U+FE51 SMALL IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA,
        U+FE52 SMALL FULL STOP,
        U+FF61 HALFWIDTH IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP,
        U+FF64 HALFWIDTH IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA.
       The UA may include other characters as appropriate.
    <p class="issue">Should other characters be included?</p>

    <p class="note">The CSS Working Group would appreciate if UAs including
      other characters would <a href="#status">inform the working group</a>
      of such additions.</p>

    <p>Support for this property is <em>optional</em>. It is recommended
      for UAs that wish to support CJK typography, particularly those in
      the Japanese market.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>The ''allow-end'' and ''force-end'' are two variations of
        hanging punctuation used in East Asia.</p>
      <div>
      <div class="sidefigure">
        <img src="hanging-punctuation-allow-end.png"
          width="202" height="51"

      <pre><code class="css"><!--
     -->p {
<!-- -->   hanging-punctuation: force-end;
<!-- -->}
<!----></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>The punctuation at the end of the first line for ''allow-end''
        does not hang, because it fits without hanging.
        However, if ''force-end'' is used, it is forced to hang.
        The justification measures the line without the hanging punctuation.
        Therefore the line is expanded.</p>

<h2 id="decoration">
  <a name="text-decoration">Text Decoration</a></h2>

  <h3 id="line-decoration">
    Line Decoration: Underline, Overline, and Strike-Through</h3>

    <p>The following properties describe line decorations that are added
      to the content of an element. When specified on or propagated to
      an inline box, such decoration affects all the boxes generated
      by that element, and is further propagated to any in-flow block-level
      boxes that split the inline
      (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1</a>)
      When specified on or propagated to a a block container that establishes
      an inline formatting context, the decorations are propagated to an
      anonymous inline element that wraps all the in-flow inline-level children
      of the block container. For all other elements, the decorations are
      propagated to any in-flow children.
      
    <p class="note">Note that text decorations are not propagated to any
      out-of-flow descendants, nor to the contents of atomic inline-level
      descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.

    <p>By default underlines, overlines, and line-throughs are applied only
      to text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing):
      margins, borders, and padding are skipped. Elements containing
      no text, such as images, are likewise not decorated.
      The 'text-decoration-skip'
      property can be used to modify this behavior, for example allowing
      inline replaced elements to be underlined or requiring that white
      space be skipped.

    <p>In determining the position and thickness of text decoration lines,
      user agents may consider the font sizes and dominant baselines of
      descendants, but for a given element's decoration must use the same
      position and thickness throughout each line box. The
      <a href="#text-decoration-color">color</a> and
      <a href="#text-decoration-style">line style</a> of decorations must
      remain the same on all decorations applied by a given element, even
      if descendant elements have different color or line style values.</p>

    <p class="issue">One use case we would like to support is to
      <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Apr/0407.html">change
      color and/or style of descendants while keeping the same position
      and thickness</a>.</p>

                   '1st' and 'a' are large."

      <p>In the three fragments of underlined text, the underline is drawn
        consecutively lower and thicker as the ratio of large text to small

    <p>Relatively positioning a descendant moves all text decorations
      affecting it along with the descendant's text; it does not affect
      calculation of the decoration's initial position on that line.
      The 'visibility' property, filters, and other graphical transformations
      likewise affect text decorations as part of the text they're drawn on,
      even if the decorations were specified on an ancestor element.

    <div class="example">
      <p>In the following style sheet and document fragment:</p>
      <pre><code class="css">
<!-- -->   blockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }
<!-- -->   em { display: block; }
<!-- -->   cite { color: fuchsia; }
<!----></code></pre>
      <pre class="html"><code>
<!-- -->   &lt;blockquote&gt;
<!-- -->    &lt;p&gt;
<!-- -->     &lt;span&gt;

<!-- -->   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
<!----></code></pre>
      <p>...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an
      anonymous inline element that surrounds the span element, causing 
      the text "Help, help!" to be blue, with the blue underlining from 
      the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the 
      blockquote element. The <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code> 
      in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to
      which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,
      but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the
      anonymous inline element.</p>

        Omitted values are set to their initial values. A 'text-decoration'

      <p>This property sets the position of an underline specified

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>''auto''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The user agent may use any algorithm to determine the
          underline's position; however in vertical typographic mode,
          if the language of the element is set to Japanese or Korean
          (matches <code>:lang(ja)</code> or <code>:lang(ko)</code>)
          the underline must be drawn on the right side of the text
          as described for ''below right''.
          <p class="note">It is suggested that the underline position
          be ''alphabetic'' unless it crosses either subscripted (or
          otherwise lowered) text, or it affects characters from Asian
          scripts such as Han or Tibetan, for which an alphabetic
          underline is too high: in such cases, aligning to the em box
          edge as described for ''below left'' is more appropriate.
        <dt><dfn>''alphabetic''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The underline is aligned with the alphabetic baseline. In
          this case the underline is likely to cross some descenders.</dd>
        <dt><dfn>''below left''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The underline is aligned with the under edge of the element's
          content box. In this case the underline usually does not cross
          the descenders. (This is sometimes called "accounting" underline.)
          If the underline affects descendants with a lower content edge,
          the user agent should shift the underline down further to the
          lowest underlined content box edge.
          The user agent may ignore elements with ''vertical-align''
          values given as lengths, percentages, ''top'', or ''bottom''
          when making this adjustment.
          (Note that images that are not affected by the underline per
          'text-decoration-skip' will not affect the position of the
          underline.)</dd>
        <dt><dfn>''below right''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>In horizontal typographic mode, this value is equivalent to
          ''below left''. In vertical typographic mode, the underline is
          aligned as for ''below left'', except it is aligned to the
          right edge of the text. If this causes the underline to be
          drawn on the "over" side of the text, then an overline also
          switches sides and is drawn on the "under" side.</dd>
      </dl>

      <div class="note">
        <p>In some cases (such as in OpenType) the font format can offer
          information about the appropriate position of an underline.
          Typically this information gives the position of an ''alphabetic''
          underline; in some cases (especially in CJK fonts), it gives
          the position of a ''below left'' underline. (In this case,
          the font's underline metrics typically touch the bottom edge
          of the em box).
          The UA is encouraged to use information (such as the underline
          thickness, or appropriate alphabetic alignment) from the font
          wherever appropriate.

    <p>This property applies emphasis marks to the element's text.
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>No emphasis marks.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:filled">''filled''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The shape is filled with solid color.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:open">''open''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The shape is hollow.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:dot">''dot''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display small circles as marks.
          The filled dot is U+2022 '&#x2022;', and the open dot is U+25E6 '&#x25e6;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:circle">''circle''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display large circles as marks.
          The filled circle is U+25CF '&#x25cf;', and the open circle is U+25CB '&#x25cb;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:double-circle">''double-circle''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display double circles as marks.
          The filled double-circle is U+25C9 '&#x25c9;', and the open double-circle is U+25CE '&#x25ce;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:triangle">''triangle''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display triangles as marks.
          The filled triangle is U+25B2 '&#x25b2;', and the open triangle is U+25B3 '&#x25b3;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:sesame">''sesame''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display sesames as marks.
          The filled sesame is U+FE45 '&#xfe45;', and the open sesame is U+FE46 '&#xfe46;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:sesame">''<var>&lt;string&gt;</var>''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display the given string as marks.
          Authors should not specify more than one <i>character</i> in &lt;string&gt;.
          The UA may truncate or ignore strings consisting of more than one grapheme cluster.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If a shape keyword is specified but neither of ''filled'' nor ''open'' is
      specified, ''filled'' is assumed. If only ''filled'' or ''open'' is specified,
      the shape keyword computes to ''circle'' in horizontal writing mode and
      ''sesame'' in vertical writing mode.</p>

    <p>The marks should be drawn using the element's font settings with its
      size scaled down to 50%. However, not all fonts have all these glyphs,
      and some fonts use inappropriate sizes for emphasis marks in these
      code points. The UA may opt to use a font known to be good for
      emphasis marks, or the marks may instead be synthesized by the UA.
      Marks must remain upright in vertical typographic modes: like CJK
      characters, they do not rotate to match the writing mode.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>One example of good fonts for emphasis marks is Adobe's opensource project,
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/kenten-generic/">Kenten Generic OpenType Font</a>,
        which is specially designed for the emphasis marks.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The marks are drawn once for each <i>character</i>. However,
      emphasis marks are not drawn for characters that are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#word-separator">Word separators</a> or that
        belong to the Unicode separator classes (Z*).
        (But note that emphasis marks <em>are</em> drawn for a space
         that combines with any combining characters.)</li>
      <li>Characters belonging to the Unicode classes for control codes
        and unassigned characters (Cc, Cf, Cn).</li>
      <li>Characters designated by 'text-emphasis-skip'.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If emphasis marks are drawn for characters
      for which ruby is drawn in the same position as the emphasis mark,
      the ruby should be stacked between the emphasis marks and the base text.
      In this case, the position of the emphasis marks for a given element
      should be determined as if all characters have ruby boxes
      of the same height as the highest ruby box in the element.
      If the UA is not capable of drawing ruby and emphasis marks on the same side,
      the UA may hide ruby and draw only emphasis marks.</p>

    <p class="note">A future level of CSS may define controls to specify

    <p>This property describes where emphasis marks are drawn at.

      <p>Note, the preferred position of emphasis marks depends on the

    <p>This property accepts a comma-separated list of shadow effects to
      be applied to the text of the element. <dfn>&lt;shadow&gt;</dfn>
      is the same as defined for the 'box-shadow' property except that
      the ''inset'' keyword is not allowed. The shadow is applied to all
      of the element's text as well as any text decorations it specifies.

    <p>The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on
      top. The shadows may thus overlay each other, but they never overlay
      the text itself. The shadow must be painted at a stack level between
      the element's border and/or background, if present, and the elements
      text and text decoration. UAs should avoid painting text shadows over
      text in adjacent elements belonging to the same stack level and stacking
      context. (This may mean that the exact stack level of the shadows depends
      on whether the element has a border or background: the exact stacking
      behavior of text shadows is thus UA-defined.)</p>

    <p>Unlike 'box-shadow', text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed
      shape and may show through if the text is partially-transparent.
      Like 'box-shadow', text shadows do not influence layout, and do not
      trigger scrolling or increase the size of the scrollable area.

    <p class="note">The painting order of shadows defined here is the opposite
      of that defined in the 1998
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512">CSS2 Recommendation</a>.</p>

    <p>The ''text-shadow'' property applies to both the
      <code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
      pseudo-elements.</p>

<h2 class="no-num" id="script-groups">Appendix E: Scripts and Spacing</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is informative (non-normative).</em></p>

  <p>Typographic behavior varies somewhat by language, but varies drastically
    by writing system. This appendix categorizes some common scripts in
    Unicode 6.0 according to their justification and spacing behavior. Category
    descriptions are descriptive, not prescriptive; the determining factor is
    the prioritization of <i>expansion opportunities</i>.

  <dl>
    <dt id="block-scripts"><dfn>block scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>CJK and by extension all Wide characters. (See [[!UAX11]])
        The following scripts are included:
        Bopomofo,
        Han,
        Hangul,
        Hiragana,
        Katakana,
        Yi
      </dd>
    <dt id="clustered-scripts"><dfn>clustered scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that have discrete units but do not use spaces between words,
        such as many Southeast Asian systems.
        The following scripts are included:
        Khmer,
        Lao,
        Myanmar,
        Thai,
      <span class="issue">This list is likely incomplete. What else fits here?</span>
      </dd>
    <dt id="connected-scripts"><dfn>connected scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Devanagari, Ogham, and other scripts that use spaces between
        words and baseline connectors within words.
        By extension this category also includes any other Indic scripts
        whose typographic behavior is similar to Devanagari.
      The following scripts are included:
      Bengali,
      Brahmi,
      Devanagari,
      Gujarati,
      Gurmukhi,
      Kannada,
      Malayalam,
      Oriya?,
      Ogham,
      Tamil?,
      Telugu
      </dd>
    <dt id="cursive-scripts"><dfn>cursive scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Arabic and similar inherently cursive scripts.
      The following scripts are included:
      Arabic,
      Mongolian,
      N'Ko?,
      Phags Pa?,
      Syriac
      </dd>
    <dt id="discrete-scripts"><dfn>discrete scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that use spaces or visible word-separating
        punctuation between words and have discrete,
        unconnected (in print) units within words.
      The following scripts are included:
      Armenian,
      Bamum?,
      Braille,
      Canadian Aboriginal,
      Cherokee,
      Coptic,
      Cyrillic,
      Deseret,
      Ethiopic
      Greek,
      Hebrew,
      Kharoshthi,
      Latin,
      Lisu,
      Osmanya,
      Shavian,
      Tifinagh,
      Vai?
      </dd>
</dl>

<p>UAs should treat unrecognized scripts as <i>discrete</i>.

<p class="issue">This listing should ideally be exhaustive wrt Unicode.
Please <a href="#status">send</a> suggestions and corrections to the CSS
Working Group.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Guidelines for classification consider letter-spacing and justification:
  <ol>
    <li>If the script is cursive and may expand cursively but must not
      space between letters, it is <i>cursive</i>.
    <li>If the script primarily flexes word separators, it is either
      <i>discrete</i> or <i>connected</i>. <i>Discrete</i> scripts can
      space between letters. <i>Connected</i> scripts must not space
      between letters (typically because that would break the connections
      or otherwise look bad).
    <li>If the script primarily expands equally between its "letters"
      in native typesettings, it is either <i>block</i> or
      <i>clustered</i>. The exact classification depends on whether it
      always spaces when mixed with CJK and sometimes stays together
      when mixed with Thai and related scripts (<i>block</i>) or
      sometimes spaces when mixed with CJK and always spaces with Thai
      (<i>clustered</i>).
