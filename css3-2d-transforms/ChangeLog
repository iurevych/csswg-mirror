- Another typo in matrix composition reported by Vincent Hardy.

2011-07-24 dino@apple.com

- Boris feedback from 26 May 2011
  - Transforms are composed matrix multiplications of the functions
  - Transforms apply to coordinate systems, not to elements
- Elika feedback from 12 May
  - examples for scale and rotate
- Boris feedback from 15 April 
  - typo in matrix recomposition

- Cleaned up skew per public-fx ACTIONs 2-5:
    - Removed skew(x, y) transform function 
    - Removed skew(x, y) from CSSMatrix API
    - Added skewX(x) and skewY(y) to CSSMatrix API

- changed transform-origin definition to match background-origin.
- clarify that transform-origin is relative to the border box.

2009-11-17 dino@apple.com

- removed the suggestion that position: relative could trigger a
  mode where transforms affect page layout. The feature is still being
  considered, but this is not a viable way to achieve it.
- removed the Point and CSSTransformValue interfaces. The point conversion
  APIs will move to CSSOM View. The CSSTransformValue interface is on
  hold while the CSSValue replacement is developed.
- added pseudo-code for matrix decomposition


2009-10-30 dino@apple.com

- noted that CSSValue is deprecated, so CSSTransformList will need updating
- added a multiplyLeft function to CSSMatrix
- noted that when animations produce singular matrices they are not rendered
- noted that the convert* methods really should be in CSSOM View
- removed mention that transforms act like position: relative
- added the text from CSS 2.1 background-position into transform-origin, in relation to the number of attributes and default values
- removed "none" from the list of accepted transform functions
- fixed error where translateZ was present and skew was missing in the animations section
- s/functions/methods in DOM section
- added DOMException to exceptions, and fixed s/ERROR/ERR/ typo
- removed mention of Z component from scale definition
- added missing skew() method to CSSMatrix
