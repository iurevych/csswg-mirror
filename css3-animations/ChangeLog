- Better start to the Keyframes section
- Example 1 changed to use an identifier, rather than a string for the keyframes name.
- Changed paragraph stating that 'from' and 'to' keyframes are required to say that these
  are implied if missing, using the computed values. Added ISSUE related to repeating animations.
- Added NOTE to clarify behavior when a property is not specified in all keyframes.
- Move the contents Animation Behavior section into the Animation section, so we introduce general
animation behavior before diving into keyframes.
