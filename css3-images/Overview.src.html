<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This CSS Image Values module defines the syntax for &lt;image&gt; values
    in CSS. &lt;image&gt; values can be a single URI to an image, a list of
    URIs denoting a series of fallbacks, sprites (image slices), or gradients.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>In CSS Levels 1 and 2, image values, such as those used in the
    'background-image' property, could only be given by a single URI
    value. This module introduces additional notations that allow a
    2D image to be given as a list of URIs denoting fallbacks, as a
    slice of a larger image (sprite), and as a gradient.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id="conformance">Conformance</h2>

  <p>A document or implementation cannot conform to CSS Image Values Level 3
    alone, but can claim conformance to CSS Image Values Level 3 if it satisfies
    the conformance requirements in this specification when implementing CSS or
    another host language that normatively references this specification.</p>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Namespaces is defined for two classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>style sheet</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style
        sheet</a> (or a complete unit of another host language that normatively
        references CSS Namespaces).
    <dt><dfn>interpreter</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Someone or something that interprets the semantics of a style sheet.
        (CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">user
        agents</a> fall under this category.)</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
    descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
    However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
    letters in this specification. All of the text of this specification is
    normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples,
    and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words "for example"
    or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
    like this:

  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Informative notes begin with the word "Note" and are set apart from the
    normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id="image">The &lt;image&gt; value type</h2>

  <p>The &lt;image&gt; value type denotes a 2D image. It is defined as

  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;image&gt;</dfn> = &lt;url&gt; | &lt;sprite&gt; | &lt;image-list&gt; | &lt;linear-gradient&gt; | &lt;radial-gradient&gt;</pre>

  <p>Image values can be used in many CSS properties, including the
    'background-image', 'list-style-image', 'cursor' properties [[!CSS21]].
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id="url">Image References and Image Slices: the ''url()'' notation</h2>

  <p>The simplest way to indicate an image is to reference an image file
  by URI. This is done with the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#uri">''url()'' notation</a>,
  defined in [[!CSS21]].

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the example below, a background image is specified with ''url()''
    syntax:</p>
    <pre>background-image: url(wavy.png);</pre>
  </div>

  <p>A portion of an image may be referenced (clipped out and used as a
  standalone image) by use of fragment identifiers.
  <span class='issue'>Need a spec to reference here. Expecting to get one from
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/">Media Fragments WG</a>.</span>

  <div class="example">
    <p>For example,</p>
    <pre>background-image: url('logos.png#xywh=10,30,60,20')</pre>
    <p>uses the 60 pixel by 20 pixel rectangle of <code>logos.png</code> beginning
    at the point 10 pixels in from the left, 30 pixels down from the top.

    <p class="note">Note that quotation marks are required here, because
    unquoted commas are not allowed in ''url()'' syntax.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id="image-notation">Image Fallbacks: the ''image()'' notation</h2>

  <p>The ''image()'' notation allows an author to specify multiple images,
  each one a fallback for the previous. The UA must use only the first image
  that it can load and display. The syntax for ''image()'' is defined as

  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;image-list&gt;</dfn> = <!--
     -->image( [ &lt;image-decl&gt; , ]* [ &lt;image-decl&gt; ] [ or &lt;color&gt; ]? )</pre>

  <p>where &lt;image-decl&gt; is given by

  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;image-decl&gt;</dfn> = <!--
    -->[ &lt;string&gt; | &lt;url-token&gt; ] [ snap? &amp;&amp; &lt;resolution&gt; ]?</pre>

  <p>&lt;url-token&gt; is given as <code>[!#$%&amp;*-~]|{nonascii}|{escape}</code>
  (i.e. the contents of ''url()'') using the productions in the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS2.1 tokenization</a>.
  <strong>The &lt;url-token&gt; must not contain unescaped brackets, commas,
  white space characters, single quotes (&#39;) or double quotes (&quot;);
  if it does the ''image()'' containing it is invalid.</strong>

  <p>Each string or url-token represents the URI of an image. If a resolution
  is given, then the image must be rendered at the specified resolution. If the
  ''snap'' keyword is also specified, and the image is a raster image, then the
  image must be rendered at the resolution closest to the specified resolution
  that would result in no pixel rounding. <span class="issue">I don't think
  "no pixel rounding" is the right terminology here... basically we want to
  avoid blurry images.</span></p>

  <p>The optional color at the end of the list is the <dfn>fallback color</dfn>.
  It is used if, and only if, none of the images can be loaded and displayed
  (e.g. because they are in unsupported formats, or cannot be found, or are
  corrupted in some way, or because image loading is disabled in the UA). It
  is treated as a single-color image with no intrinsic dimensions.

  <div class="example">
    <p>For example, the rule below would tell the UA to load ''wavy.svg'' if
      it can; failing that to load ''wavy.png'' and display it at 150dpi;
      failing that to display ''wavy.gif''; and finally, if none of the images
      can be loaded and displayed, to use the color ''blue'' to create a
      dimensionless background image.
      <pre>background-image: image(wavy.svg, 'wavy.png' 150dpi, "wavy.gif"  or blue);</pre>
    <p>The 'background-image' property specifies that dimensionless images
       must stretch to cover the entire background positioning area
       [[CSS3BG]], so if none of the specified images can be displayed
       the background will be painted blue. As with any image, this fallback
       will be painted over the 'background-color' (if any).
  </div>

  <p>If the URL for the image ends in a file extension (a period followed by
  letters) of four ascii letters ([a-zA-Z]) or less, then the UA <em>may</em>
  skip trying to load images whose file extension matches an image format it
  knows it does not support. For example, a UA that knows it supports JPEG and
  GIF, but expects to encounter many PNG and SVG images may choose to skip over
  images with filenames ending in '.png' or '.svg' without loading them to
  check their MIME type. However it must not skip over images with filenames
  ending in extensions it doesn't recognize.
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Image Sprites</h2>

  <p>The image sprites syntax is different from image slices noted above.
    Image slice syntax allows you to specify the coordinates of a region
    in the image and use that as a standalone image, but all the coordinates
    must be specified inline. This is great for one-off cutouts, but becomes
    unnecessarily verbose when the slices fit into a grid structure. The goal
    of this section is to define a syntax that:
  <ul>
    <li>Makes it easy to specify an image slice and swap it out in later
      subclass or :hover rules.
    <li>Makes it easy to maintain a sprite image, so that adding or shifting
      sections of the image don't require crawling through and modifying the
      entire style sheet.
    <li>Has straightforward handling of strict grids, but can also handle
      more irregular sprite organization.
    <li>(Any other use cases/requirements?)
  </ul>

<div>
	<h2>Gradients</h2>
	<p>A gradient is a browser-generated image specified entirely in CSS, which consists of smooth fades between several colors. There are two basic kinds of gradients currently defined, linear and radial. These are specified by the linear-gradient() and radial-gradient() functions, and can be used any place an image can currently be used.</p>
	<p>In many places this specification references a box, such as "the box's top-left corner" or "the box's right side". In all of these circumstances, the box refers to the rectangle that would be filled by an SVG image without intrinsic dimensions used in the same context. See the CSS 2.1 spec for clarification on this.</p>
	<div>
		<h3>Linear Gradients</h3>
		<p>A linear gradient is created by specifying a gradient-line and then several colors placed along that line. The image is constructed by creating an infinite canvas and painting it with lines perdendicular to the gradient-line, with the color of the painted line being the color of the gradient-line where the two intersect.  It is defined by:</p>
		<pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;linear-gradient&gt;</dfn> = linear-gradient([&lt;bg-position&gt; || &lt;angle&gt;,]? &lt;color-stop&gt;, &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]*);</pre>
		<p>The first argument to the function specifies the <strong>gradient-line</strong>, which gives the gradient a direction.  The gradient typically starts at the starting-point and ends at the ending-point, but this is not a firm requirement.  The starting-point merely defines where 0%, 0px, etc are located when used in the <code>&lt;color-stop&gt;</code> construction, and the ending-point defines where 100% is.  Color-stops can have values below 0 or above 100%, and they refer to positions on the gradient-line before the starting-point or after the ending-point as expected.</p>
		<p><pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;bg-position&gt;</dfn></pre> is taken from the Backgrounds and Borders Module, and has the same definition.  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;angle&gt;</dfn></pre> is from the Values Module, and has the same definition; if relevant, the angle is normalized to within the range [0,360deg).</p>
		<p>If the <code>&lt;angle&gt;</code> is omitted in the first argument, the <code>&lt;bg-position&gt;</code> specifies the starting-point of the gradient-line.  The ending-point is obtained by rotating the starting-point 180 degrees around the center of the box.  For example, specifying "right" would place the starting-point in the center of the right edge of the box (as described by Backgrounds and Borders) and the ending-point in the center of the left edge, producing a horizontal gradient that went from right to left.  Specifying "top left" would place the starting-point in the top-left corner of the box, and the ending-point in the bottom-right corner of the box, and would produce a diagonal gradient.  Specifying "left 10px" would place the starting-point at the left edge, 10px from the top and the ending-point on the right edge, 10px from the bottom - if you would like a horizontal gradient that start 10px in from the left edge, specify "10px center" or "left 10px center".  Refer to the Backgrounds and Borders Module for more examples.</p>
		<p>If both <code>&lt;bg-position&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;angle&gt;</code> are specified, then the starting-point is determined by the <code>&lt;bg-position&gt;</code>.  To determine the ending point, extend the gradient-line from the starting point at the specified angle.  An angle of 0deg corresponds to straight right, 90deg corresponds to straight up, etc.  The end point is the point on the gradient-line where a line drawn perpendicular from that point would cross the furthest corner of the box.  (If there is no such ending point, for example if the starting-point is "-10px -10px" and the angle is "180deg", then the ending-point is identical to the starting-point.)</p>
		<p>If the <code>&lt;bg-position&gt;</code> is omitted in the first argument, the starting-point is in one of the box's corners, based on the <code>&lt;angle&gt;</code>.  If the angle is between [0deg,90deg), the starting point is the bottom-left corner.  If the angle is between [90deg,180deg), the starting point is the bottom-right corner.  If the angle is between [180deg,270deg), the starting point is the top-right corner.  If the angle is between [270deg,360deg), the starting point is the top-left corner.  The ending-point is determined in the manner described by the previous paragraph.</p>
		<p>If both are omitted, it is equivalent to simply specifying "top" for the first argument, and defines a vertical gradient.</p>
		<p>If both starting-point and ending-point are the same, then the gradient is just a solid color, defined by the last color-stop in the list.  For example, "left top 90deg", and "center center" will both result in a solid-color gradient.</p>

		<p>Color-stops are given by:</p>
		<pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;color-stop&gt;</dfn></pre> = &lt;color&gt; [ &lt;percentage&gt; | &lt;length&gt; ]?</code></pre>
		<p>The color-stops are points placed along the line defined by the gradient-line at the beginning of the rule.  Percentages refer to the length of the gradient-line, with 0% being at the starting point and 100% being at the ending point.  Lengths are measured from the starting-point in the direction of the ending-point.  With either measure, color-stops may be placed before the starting-point or after the ending-point; this is perfectly valid, as the starting-point and ending-point are just convenient references, and do not directly interact in the display of the gradient.  At each color-stop, the line is the color of the color-stop.  Between two color-stops, the colors are interpolated as SVG gradients.  Before the first color-stop, the line is the color of the first color-stop.  After the last color-stop, the line is the color of the last color-stop.</p>
		<p>If the first color-stop does not have a <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code>, it defaults to 0%. If the last color-stop does not have a <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code>, it defaults to 100%.  If any other color-stop does not have a <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code> specified, then all adjacent color-stops without a <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code> are collected together, and then evenly spaced between the color-stops on the boundaries that do have a <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code>.</p>
		<p>If multiple color-stops fall on the same point, they produce an infinitesimal transition from the one specified first in the rule to the one specified last.  In effect, the color suddenly changes at that point rather than smoothly transitioning.</p>
		<p>Color-stops must be specified in order.  If a color-stop ever specifies a position that would place it before an earlier color-stop, it instead uses the position of the previous color-stop.  It is recommended that authors not mix different types of units, such as px, em, or %, in a single rule, as this can cause a color-stop to unintentionally try to move before an earlier one.  For example, the rule <code>linear-gradient(left / red, yellow 100px, blue 50%)</code> would work as expected as long as the gradient's block was at least 200px wide.  If it was 150px wide, however, the blue color-stop would resolve to "75px", before the yellow.  Instead, the blue defaults to 100px, same as the yellow color-stop.</p>
		
		<h3>Linear Gradient Examples</h3>
		<div class="example">
			<h4>A basic vertical gradient</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(top, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(bottom, blue, yellow);
background: linear-gradient(-90deg, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(270deg, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(top, yellow 0%, blue 100%);
background: linear-gradient(center top, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(yellow, blue);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad1.png" alt="" ></p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h4>A basic corner-to-corner diagonal gradient</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(top left, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(0 0, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(top 0px left 0px, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(bottom right, blue, yellow);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad2.png" alt="" ></p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h4>A basic angle gradient</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(-45deg, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(315deg, yellow, blue);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad4.png" alt="" ></p>
			<p>Notice how the preceding example is similar to the second example.  In both gradients, the top-left of the box is pure yellow, and the bottom-right of the box is pure blue.  The difference is in the angle that the gradient follows.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h4>A 3-color vertical gradient</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(top, yellow, blue, #0f0);
background: linear-gradient(top, yellow, blue 50%, #0f0);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad5.png" alt="" ></p>
			<p>In this particular case <code>linear-gradient(top, yellow, blue 100px, #0f0)</code> would also create the given image, because of the specific dimensions of the box.  If the box's dimensions were changed, the two would specify different images.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h4>A 3-color gradient with unevenly spaced stops</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(top, yellow, blue 20%, #0f0);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad6.png" alt="" ></p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h4>A gradient using a complex starting and ending point</h4>
			<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(20px 30px, yellow, blue);
background: linear-gradient(left 20px top 30px, yellow, blue);</code></pre>
			<p><img src="http://www.xanthir.com/etc/gradient-examples/grad7.png" alt="" ></p>
			<p>Notice that in this example a substantial portion of the image is pure yellow and pure blue, because the starting and ending points of the gradient-line are not on the box edge, but rather somewhere within the box.</p>
