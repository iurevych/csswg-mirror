	<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design.
	In flexbox layout model, the children of a box are laid out either 
	horizontally or vertically, and unused space can be assigned to a particular 
	child or distributed among the children by assignment of &quot;flex&quot; to the 
	children that should expand. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside 
	vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two 
	dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="overview">
Overview</h2>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes, algorithms which determine the size and 
	position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor 
	boxes: block layout, designed for laying out documents and simple applications,
	inline layout, designed for laying out text,
	table layout, designed for laying out information in a tabular format, and 
	positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard 
	for other elements in the document. This module introduces a new layout mode, 
	flexbox layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and 
	webpages.</p>

	<p>Flexbox layout is superficially similar to block layout.  It lacks many of 
	the more complex text or document-formatting properties that can be used in 
	block layout, such as 'float' and 'columns', but in return it gains more simple
	and powerful tools for aligning its contents in ways that webapps and complex
	web pages often need.  </p>
    
	<p>Flexbox layout operates exclusively on immediate block-level children, 
	which are referred to as<dfn> flexbox item</dfn>s. Flexbox may directly 
	contain inline children or out of flow content, in which case flexbox item 
	fixup is performed, as described below.</p>

    <p><em>Flexbox items </em>can be laid out in any direction,
	can have their order swapped around dynamically, and can "flex" their sizes
	and positions to respond to the available space.</p>
<p>If <dfn>multiline</dfn> option is enabled (by including one of &#39;wrap-&#39; keywords in 
&#39;flex-flow&#39; property), flexbox items flow in two dimensions, wrapping lines of 
items similarly to wrapping lines of text. The two-dimensional flow can have 
any combination of directions, matching current writing mode (logical), 
independent of writing mode (physical) or mixed. </p>
<p>In flexbox, the term <dfn>main axis</dfn> refers to the primary 
direction of flow of <i>flexbox item</i>s, the direction in which items are 
added to layout in a single line flexbox, or in one line of multiline flexbox. 
Main axis direction determines logical &#39;start&#39; and &#39;end&#39;.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>cross axis</dfn> refers to the direction orthogonal to main axis. 
Direction of defines logical &#39;before&#39; and &#39;after&#39; for alignment and direction of 
wrapping when wrapping is enabled.</p>

	<p>Similar to other layout modes such as table layout, a flexbox acts like a
	block when placed into other layout modes.  Inline flexboxes can also be declared, 
	which act like inline-blocks.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;p style="width: 400px; display: flexbox;">
	&lt;button style="width: 200px;">Child 1&lt;/button>
	&lt;button style="width: 100px;">Child 2&lt;/button>
&lt;/p>
</pre>

		<p>In this example, the first button is 200 pixels wide and the second button is
		100 pixels wide. As the flexbox is 400 pixels wide, there is extra space left over
		which is placed after the two buttons but inside the flexbox. The placement of this
		extra space may be modified using the various flex properties described in the next
		sections. Neither the height of the buttons nor the height of the flexbox are specified,
		so the height is computed intrinsically from the content. In this case, the buttons
		will be the height needed to display the label and button border, and the flexbox will
		also be this height plus any margins around the buttons.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="issue">this needs a picture</p>

<h2 id=display-flexbox>
New values for 'display' property</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:
				<td>display
			<tr>
				<th>New value:
				<td>flexbox | inline-flexbox
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>You can declare that an element is a flexbox, and thus should use flexbox 
	layout, by setting the &#39;display&#39; property on the element to the value 
	&#39;flexbox&#39; or &#39;inline-flexbox&#39;.</p>
<p>Flexbox establishes a new block formatting context for its content.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id=flex-items>
Flexbox Items</h2>
<p>Flexbox layout algorithm operates on <em>flexbox items.</em>

	<p>Flexbox items are:<ol>
	<li>Immediate block-level children of flexbox</li>
	<li>Atomic inline-level children of flexbox</li>
	<li>Contiguous run of non-replaced
	inline children, wrapped into an anonymous block</li>
</ol>

	<div class="example">
	Examples of flexbox items
	<pre>
&lt;div style=&quot;display:flexbox&quot;&gt;

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;item1&quot;&gt;block&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;item2&quot; style=&quot;display:table&quot;&gt;table&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous table wrapped around table-cell --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;item3&quot; style=&quot;display:table-cell&quot;&gt;table-cell&lt;/div&gt; 

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous block around inline content --&gt;
    anonymous item 4                                            

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;item5&quot;&gt;block&lt;/div&gt;                                 

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous block around inline content --&gt;
    anonymous item 6.1
    &lt;span id=&quot;item6.1&quot;&gt;
        text 6.2
        &lt;div id=&quot;not-an-item6.3&quot;&gt;block&lt;/div&gt;
        text 6.4
    &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level replaced element --&gt;
    &lt;img id=&quot;item7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-level replaced element --&gt;
    &lt;img id=&quot;item7&quot; style=&quot;display:inline&quot;&gt;

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-level replaced element --&gt;
    &lt;button id=&quot;item8&quot;&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-table --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;item9&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-table&quot;&gt;table&lt;/div&gt;     
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	Notice that block element "not-an-item6.3" is not a separate flexbox item, because it is contained inside an inline element which is being wrapped into an anonymous flex item.
	</div>
<p>Out-of-flow elements like absolutely positioned elements
	leave behind a 'placeholder' inline element in their original position in the
	document <p class=issue>This needs to change. Placeholder is not fully hypothetical in this case, 
that element or line is detectable in &quot;flex-pack:justify&quot;. TODO: define the 
&quot;auto&quot; positoin without a placeholder.&nbsp;

	<p>Setting ''display:flexbox'' on an element forces it to use a new layout 
	algorithm, and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of 
	block layout don't make sense in a flexbox context.  In particular:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module compute to their initial 
		values on a flexbox ('break-before', 'break-inside', and 'break-after' are still 
		valid on a flexbox).</li>
		<li>'float' and 'clear' compute to their initial values on a flexbox item</li>
		<li>'vertical-align' has no effect on a flexbox item</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="issue">It has been proposed that vertical-align property applies to flex items 
	(simliar to table cells). Decide if it makes sense, or if it should instead apply broader (to any blocks). </p>

<p>
A flexbox item creates a new BFC.  The margins of a flexbox item 
	do not collapse with any other margin.  Flexboxes "shrinkwrap" their contents
	by default (when their 'width' or 'height' properties are ''auto''), similar
	to tables or floats.</p>

<h2 id='flex-order'>
Display Order: the 'flex-order' property</h2>

	<p><i>flexbox item</i>s are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order
	as they appear in the source document.  The 'flex-order' property may be used
	to change this ordering.</p>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-order</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;integer>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>1
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td><i>flexbox item</i>s</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
	</table>

	<p><i>Flexbox item</i>s may be assigned to ordinal groups using the 'flex-order'
	property.  This property is an integer with an initial value of 1.</p>

	<p>Ordinal groups control the order in which <i>flexbox item</i>s appear.  A flexbox
	will lay out its content starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and
	going up.  Items with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they
	appear in the source document.

	<div class=example>
		<p>This example shows how ordinal groups might be used.</p>
		<pre><code>	div { display: flexbox; }
	#item1 { flex-order: 2; }
	#item3 { flex-order: 2; }
	#item4 { flex-order: 1; }

	&lt;div>
		&lt;div id="item1">item1&lt;/div>
		&lt;div id="item2">item2&lt;/div>
		&lt;div id="item3">item3&lt;/div>
		&lt;div id="item4">item4&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div></code></pre>

		<p>The first ordinal group, 1, contains item2 and item4. As item2 does not 
		specify an ordinal group, it will default to 1. The elements will be displayed 
		in document order, so item2 will be displayed before item4. The second ordinal 
		group, 2, contains the remaining two items. The resulting display order will 
		be:</p>

		<pre><code>item2 item4 item1 item3</code></pre>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id='flexibility'>
Flexibility</h2>

	<p>The defining aspect of flexbox layout is the ability to make various lengths
	of the <i>flexbox item</i>s flexible.  The 'width', 'height', 'padding', and 
	'margin' properties of a <i>flexbox item</i> can all be made flexible.  Paddings
	and margins are made flexible by setting their value to ''auto'', while the
	width and height of a box can be controlled more precisely with the ''flex()'' function, defined below.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p class=issue>TODO: Examples!</p>
	</div>

<h3 id='resolving-flexible-lengths'>
Resolving Flexible Lengths</h3>

	<p>Flexbox layout resolves a <i>flexible length</i> into a definite length by first collecting
	all the lengths, flexible or inflexible, that will share some space.  For example,
	for a horizontal flexbox, the lengths of the left and right margins, left and right
	borders, left and right paddings, and widths of all <i>flexbox item</i>s share
	the width of the flexbox itself.  Conversely, each 
	<i title="flexbox item">flexbox item's</i> vertical margins, borders, padding, 
	and height individually share the height of the flexbox.</p>

	<div class=figure>
		<p class="caption issue">TODO: Diagram showing the relevant lengths
		in each axis.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Flexbox layout then sums the <dfn>preflex size</dfn> of the lengths in each set.  The
	<i>preflex size</i> of an inflexible length is just the length itself.  The
	<i>preflex size</i> of a flexible length is its <i>preferred size</i>.  If the 
	sum of all the <i title="preflex size">preflex sizes</i> is less than the 
	available width/height of the flexbox, then the difference is split up among all the 
	<i title="flexible length">flexible lengths</i> with <dfn>positive flexibility</dfn>, 
	with the space divvied up proportionally to the flexibility of each length.  If 
	the sum is greater than the available width/height, then all the
	<i title="flexible length">flexible lengths</i> with <dfn>negative flexibility</dfn>
	shrink in proportion to their flexibility to try and make the sum equal the 
	available width/height.</p>
 
	<p>The 'flex-pack' and 'flex-align' properties offer additional options for free-space distribution.  The precise details of how free space is determined 
	and assigned to flexible lengths is detailed in a later chapter.</p>

<h3 id='flex-function'>
The ''flex()'' function</h3>
 
	<p>The ''flex()'' function is used to specify the parameters of a
	<i>flexible length</i>: the <i title="positive flexibility">positive</i> 
	and <i>negative flexibility</i>, and the <i>preferred size</i>.  The syntax
	of the ''flex()'' function is roughly (see following prose for a precise
	description):</p>

	<pre class=prod>flex( [ <i title="positive flexibility">&lt;pos-flex></i> || <!--
	--><i title="negative flexibility">&lt;neg-flex></i> || <!--
	--><i title="preferred size">&lt;preferred-size></i> ] )</pre>
<p>Applicable to 'width' and 'height'</p>
<p class="note">In the future this may be applicable to margin and padding</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>If the ''flex()'' function contains a single value:</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>If the value is a non-negative number, the <i>positive flexibility</i> 
				is set to that value, the <i>negative flexibility</i> is set to

				<li>Otherwise, if the value is a &lt;length>, a &lt;percentage>,
				or a valid keyword, the <i>preferred size</i>

				are set to initial value (zero)</li>

				<li>Otherwise, the ''flex()'' function is invalid.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>

		<dt>If the ''flex()'' function contains two values:</dt>

			<p>The values of this property have the following meanings. See text for more specifics as to how children are

   <dt>before

   <dd>The &#39;before&#39; edge of the child box along<em> cross axis </em>is aligned with &#39;before&#39; edge of the

   <dt>baseline

   <dd>&nbsp;If this child&#39;s inline axis is parallel to <em>main axis</em> of 
   the flexbox, the baseline of the child box is aligned with baselined of all

   <dt>stretch

   <dd>The height of each child is adjusted to that of the containing block.
    However, note the text below.
  </dl>

			<p>Direction of the <em>cross axis </em>is determined as follows:</p>
				<p>In multi-line flexbox, <em>cross axis </em>points in the 
				direction of wrapping (the side where lines are added)</p>
				<p>In single-line flexbox, the direction of <em>cross axis</em> is 
				determined by the computed value of writing mode of the flexbox 
				element.</p>
				<ul>
				<li> If flexbox&#39;s <em>main axis </em>is parallel to inline axis of 
				the writing mode, <em>cross axis</em> points in the direction of 
				block flow</li>
					<li> If flexbox&#39;s <em>main axis </em>is parallel to block flow 
					axis of the writing mode, <em>cross axis</em> points in the 
					direction of inline flow</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>The following rules should be applied when determining the size of
   		 child boxes along the<em> cross axis</em>. Exceptions to these rules 
			are noted under each of the possible values of &#39;<code class=property><a
   href="#propdef-flex-align">flex-align</a></code>&#39; below.

  		  <p>First, the <em>cross axis </em>size of content box of the flexbox 
		  has to be calculated. If computed value of flexbox&#39;s width or height 
		  (whichever is along the<em> cross axis</em>), that value is used. If 
		  it is &#39;auto&#39;, the size is determined by flexbox items, as follows:<ol>
				<li><em>Cross-axis s</em>izes of margin boxes of all children in 
				are checked and the biggest is selected.</li>
				<li>If there are any children with baseline alignemnt, biggest 
				ascent (including its margin-before) and biggest descent 
				(including its margin-after) are found.</li>
				<li>Flexbox&#39;s content box size is the size its biggest child or 
				the sum of the biggest ascent and biggest descent, whichever is 
				larger</li>
			</ol>

  <p>All normal flow children of boxes will attempt to satisfy the following
   sizing equation when placed inside vertical boxes if and only if at least
   one of the specified values is auto:

  <p>&#39;<code class=property>margin-left</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>border-left-width</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>padding-left</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>width</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>padding-right</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>border-right-width</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>margin-right</code>&#39; = width of containing box

  <p>and a similar equation for height when placed inside horizontal boxes:

  <p>&#39;<code class=property>margin-top</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>border-top-width</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>padding-top</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>height</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>padding-bottom</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>border-bottom-width</code>&#39; + &#39;<code
   class=property>margin-bottom</code>&#39; = height of containing box

  <p>If all the values in the equation are specified (i.e., if there are no
   auto values), then the equation above does not apply, and the specified
   values should be used. If applying the equation results in a negative
   value for width/height, then that value is set to 0, and those values
   should be used.

  <p>If the value of <span class=property>&#39;<code class=property><a
   href="#propdef-flex-align">flex-align</a></code>&#39;</span> is <span
   class=property>&#39;stretch&#39;</span>, then elements obey the sizing rules 
  specified above. This is the default value. If both width/height and one or 
  both margin values are &#39;<code class=property>auto</code>&#39;, the &#39;<code class=property>auto</code>&#39; 
  margins are set to 0 and the equation is used to find a value for 
  width/height. Otherwise, if both margins are &#39;<code class=property>auto</code>&#39;, then the
   equation is solved under the additional constraint that the two margins
   must get the same value. If neither the width/height or either margin is
   auto, then the extra space is positioned as if flex-align was &#39;before&#39;.

  <p>If the value of <span class=property>&#39;<code class=property><a
   href="#propdef-flex-align">flex-align</a></code>&#39;</span> is before, middle, 
  baseline or after, and a value of &#39;<code
   class=property>auto</code>&#39; is specified for width/height, then the
   intrinsic size (or shrink to fit size) of the element should be used. If
   one margin has the value of auto, then the equations above should be used.
   If both margins have a value of auto then the above equations should be
   used, with the space being divided evenly between the two margins. These
   rules are similar to the rules for replaced elements inside blocks.

  <p>If the above would cause the width or height to greater than the
   computed maximum width or height, then the width or height is set to the
   maximum width or height, and the auto margins increased by the extra
   amount left over. If both margins are auto, they should both be increased
   by the same amount. If neither margin is auto, the extra space is placed
   as necessary depending on the flex-align value.

  <p>Once the sizes are computed, the margin boxes of the elements should be
   aligned at the before, middle, baseline or after edge of the box.

			<h2 id=multiline>Multi-line flexbox</h2>
			<p>If no &#39;wrap-&#39; keyword is included in &#39;flex-flow&#39;, flexbox lays out its 
  items in a single row or column; any items that don't fit will simply be considered
   overflow.

  	  	  <p>Adding any of the &#39;wrap-&#39; keywords to &#39;flex-flow&#39; enables multi-line mode. 
  Then flexbox is allowed to
   expand to multiple lines (that is, multiple rows or columns) in order to
   accommodate all of its items. Flexbox must attempt to fit its items
   on as few lines as possible by shrinking all items down to their
   minimum widths or heights if necessary.

  	  	  <p>If the items still do not fit on a line after
   being reduced to their minimum widths or heights, then items are moved one by one
   onto a new line, until the items remaining on the previous line fit.
   This process can repeat to an arbitrary number of lines. If a line
   contains only a single item that doesn't fit, then the item should
   stay on that line and overflow out of the box. The later lines are placed
   according to wrap direction specified in 'flex-flow'.

  	  	  <p>The cross-axis size of a line is the cross-axis size of the largest item
   in that line. No additional space appears between the lines apart from the
   margins on the largest items in each line. For calculating the cross-axis size
   of a line, margins with a computed value of auto should be treated as
   having a value of 0.

  	  	  <p>Once the number of lines has been determined, items with non-zero flexibility
   stretch as necessary in an attempt to fill
   the remaining space on the lines. Each line computes flexes independently,
   so only elements on that line are considered when evaluating flex. 
   The packing of elements in a line, as specified by the
   flex-pack property, is also computed independently for each line.

  	  	  <div class=example>
			  <p>This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally.</p>
			  <pre>    #div1 {
      display: flexbox;
      flex-flow: wrap;
      width: 300px;
    }
    button {
      width: flex(80px 1.0);
    }

    &lt;div id="div1"&gt;
      &lt;button id="button1"&gt;Elephant&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button id="button2"&gt;Tiger&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button id="button3"&gt;Antelope&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button id="button4"&gt;Wildebeest&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
			  <p>The buttons are shrunk to their minimum widths, in this case 80 pixels. 
   This will allow the first three buttons to
    fit in 240 pixels with 60 pixels left over of remaining space. Because
    the box-lines property has a specified value of multiple, the fourth
    button may be moved onto a second line.</p>
			  <p>Flexibility is applied to each element, separately for each line. The
    first line has 60 pixels of remaining space, so each of the three buttons
    on that line will receive 20 pixels of extra width. The remaining button
    on a line of its own will stretch to the entire width of the containing
    box, or 300 pixels.</p>
			  <div style="width:300px; border:medium solid green">
				  <button style="width:100px">Elephant</button
      ><button style="width:100px">Tiger</button
      ><button style="width:100px">Antelope</button
      ><button style="width:300px">Wildebeest</button></div>
			  <p>If the box was resized, the buttons may rearrange onto different lines
    as necessary. If the style rules in the example above were changed to the
    following:</p>
			  <pre>    #div1 {
      display: flexbox;
      flex-flow: wrap;
      flex-pack: center;
      width: 300px;
    }
    button {
      width: flex(80px 1.0);
      max-width: 90px;
    }
</pre>
			  <p>Now, each of the buttons will only stretch to include an additional 10
    pixels of width, as the maximum width of 90 pixels is only 10 pixels
    larger than the minimum intrinsic width of the buttons. The remaining 30
    pixels of space left over is divided up and placed inside the box outside
    of the buttons, as the value of box-pack is center. The fourth button
    will also appear at 90 pixels wide, centered within the box.</p>
			  <div style="width:300px; border:medium solid green; text-align:center;">
				  <button style="width:90px">Elephant</button
      ><button style="width:90px">Tiger</button
      ><button style="width:90px">Antelope</button
      ><button style="width:90px">Wildebeest</button></div>

			<p class="issue">TODO: define how flexbox should break on pages, columns, etc.

			<li>Breaking behavior of a single-line vertical flexbox should be

			<li>Breaking behavior of a horizontal single-line flexbox sholud be

				<p>This section seems necessary, but not the precise way it's written.  I
		need to identify precisely what data needs to be exposed both by the containing
		measure model (for the flexbox to use) and by the flexbox (for the containing
		measure model to use), and then write that up.  Then the other measure models
		we produce can re-use the same template.</p>
				<p>Need to define:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The min/max/fit-content widths and heights of flexboxes in block contents</li>
					<li>Other stuff?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
			TODO: I have no idea what this is trying to say. Yes, it has to be 
			defined how auto sizing and min/max work on flexbox itself. That 
			could be a separate section. What else is meant to be here?<!--
  <p>
   A box placed in a block is considered a block level element and will be positioned
   and sized according to the rules for CSS 2.1 (section 10.3 for widths). Specifically,
   the following equation applies for calculating the width:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + scrollbar width (if any) = width of containing block
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All children of 'box' elements are block-level. If inline-level elements are nested
     inside boxes, they get wrapped in an anonymous block which then takes part in the
     box layout.

  </p><p>
     If the width of a child of a flexible box is computed as 'auto', then the used value
     is the shrink-to-fit width. This calculation is done similarly to how the width of
     a floating element is determined. Otherwise if the width has a computed value,
     then that value is used as the width.
  </p><p>

     In a horizontally oriented box, the flexibility is then applied which may increase
     or decrease the used width. In a vertically oriented box, the position and size
     of the child may be adjusted by the value of the container's
     <span class="property">'flex-align'</span> property.
  </p><p>

     The <span class="property">'min-width'</span>, <span class="property">'min-height'</span>,
     <span class="property">'max-width'</span>, and <span class="property">'max-height'</span>
     CSS properties act the same on boxes as on blocks.
  </p><p>

     The height of a child of a flexible box is determined in the same manner as specified
     in the CSS specification. The used height may further be adjusted by the container's
     <span class="property">'flex-align'</span> property in a horizontally
     oriented box, or the flexibility in a vertically oriented box.
  </p><p>

     Note that it is possible for a horizontally oriented box that the height of a
     flexible child containing an inline descendant will change when the flexibility is
     applied. Similarly, in a vertically oriented box, the height of a child may change
     based on the <span class="property">'flex-align'</span> property of the
     box.
