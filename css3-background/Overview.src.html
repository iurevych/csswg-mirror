<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured
documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc.
This draft contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to
borders and backgrounds. It includes and extends the functionality of
CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1
[[CSS1]]. The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are borders
consisting of images, boxes with multiple backgrounds, boxes with
rounded corners and boxes with shadows.

<p>This module replaces two earlier drafts: CSS3 Backgrounds and CSS3
Border.



<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="status">Status of this document</h2>
<!--status-->

<p><strong>Not all the corrections and clarifications in the revised
edition of CSS2 [[!CSS21]] have been applied to this draft yet. In
case of conflict (other than on properties and values that are clearly
new to CSS3), CSS&nbsp;2.1 probably represents the intention of the
CSS WG better than this draft.</strong>

<p class=issue>The CSS WG maintains an <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/products/11">issues
list</a> for this module.

<p>The following features are at-risk and may be dropped at the
end of the CR period: inner shadows for 'box-shadow', ''no-clip''
keyword for 'background-clip'.


<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="contents">Table of contents</h2>
<!--toc-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

<p>When elements are rendered according to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html">CSS box model</a> [[!CSS21]],
each element is either not displayed at all, or formatted as one
or more rectangular boxes. Each box has a rectangular content
area, a band of padding around the content, a border around the
padding, and a margin outside the border. (The margin may actually be
negative, but margins have no influence on the background and border.)

<div class="figure">
  <p><img src="box" alt="Diagram of a typical box, showing the
  content, padding, border and margin areas">

  <p class="caption">The various areas and edges of a typical box.
  (This diagram is explained in the CSS2.1 Box Model chapter [[!CSS21]].)
</div>

<p>The child elements of an element usually create boxes of their own,
that are placed inside the content area of their parent, although they
may also be placed outside it.

<p>The reason an element may result in more than one box, is that
elements may be broken at the end of a line (for inline elements), at
the end of a column or at the end of a page and create further boxes
in the next line, column or page.

<p>The properties of this module deal with the contents of the border
area and with the background of the content, padding and border areas.

<p>That background may be fully transparent (the default), or it may
be filled with a color, one or more images, or both images and color.
The background properties specify what color (
'background-color') and images (
'background-image') to use, where they are
placed ( 'background-position'), whether
they are repeated or scaled (
'background-repeat',
'background-size'), etc.

<p>The 'border-image' property can also
define a background image, which, if present, is added on top of that
of the background properties.

<p>The border can either be a predefined style (solid line, double
line, dotted line, pseudo-3D border, etc.) or it can be an image. In
the former case, three properties define the style of the four border
sides ( 'border-style'), color (
'border-color') and thickness (
'border-width'). In the latter case, the sides
and corners are taken from the sides and corners of an image specified
with 'border-image'. The image can be
sliced, scaled and stretched in various ways to fit the size of the
border.

<p>If an element is broken into multiple boxes,
'border-break' and
'background-break' define how the borders
and background are divided over the various boxes.

<p>There is also another kind of decoration that can be
added to an element: a drop shadow, via the
'box-shadow' property.

<h2>Values</h2>

<p>This specification follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].</p>

<p>''&lt;color&gt;'' values are defined in CSS Color Level 3 [[!CSS3COLOR]].</p>

<p>''&lt;image&gt;'' values are defined by this specification as ''&lt;uri&gt;''.
(A future specification may expand the definition of ''&lt;image&gt;'' to allow
other values, e.g. to define image slices.)</p>

<p>All other values are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].</p>

<h2>Background properties</h2>

<h3 id="layering">Layering multiple background images</h3>

<p>The background of a box can have multiple layers in CSS3. The number
of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the
'background-image' property. Note that a value of 'none' still creates
a layer.

<p>Each of the images is repeated, sized, and positioned according to
the corresponding value in the other background properties. The lists
are matched up from the first value: excess values at the end are not
used. If a property doesn't have enough comma-separated values to match
the number of layers, the UA must calculate its used value by repeating
the list of values until there are enough.

<div class="example">
<p>For example, this set of declarations:
<pre>
background-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass.png);
background-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left, bottom right;
background-origin: border-box, content-box;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
</pre>
<p>has exactly the same effect as this set with the extra position
dropped and the missing values for 'background-origin' and
'background-repeat' filled in (emphasized for clarity):
<pre>
background-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass1.png);
background-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left;
background-origin: border-box, content-box<strong>, border-box</strong>;
background-repeat: no-repeat<strong>, no-repeat, no-repeat</strong>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first image in the list is the layer closest to the user,
the next one is painted behind the first, and so on. The background
color, if present, is painted below all of the other layers.

<h3>The 'background-color' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-color</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td>&lt;color&gt; [ &lt;color&gt; ]?
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>transparent
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>the computed color(s)
</table>

<p>This property sets the background color of an element. The color is
drawn behind any background images. The second color, if present,
is used instead of the first color in the case the element's specified
bottom-most background image, if any, fails to load or cannot be displayed
(e.g. because it is in an unsupported format or is corrupted in some way).
This color is called the <dfn>fallback color.</dfn>

<div class="example">
<p>Example:
<pre>h1 { background-color: #F00 }
div { background-color: transparent white; }</pre>
</div>

<p>Both the normal color and the fallback color are clipped according
to the 'background-clip' value associated with the bottom-most
background image.

<div class="issue">
<p>A previous draft used the syntax
<pre>background-color: &lt;color&gt; [ / &lt;color&gt; ]? |  / &lt;color&gt;</pre>
<p>where omission of the first color implied the initial value
(i.e. ''transparent''). Examples:</p>
<pre>
  background-color: / white; /* Equivalent to background-color: transparent / white; */
  background: url(pattern.png) / lightskyblue;
</pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre>
  background-color: transparent white;
  background: url(pattern.png) transparent lightskyblue;
</pre>
<p>The slash was <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jan/0081.html">dropped</a>
because a slash is already used in the <code>background</code>
shorthand to distinguish <code>background-size</code> from
<code>background-position</code>, and this would make the parsing
the <code>background</code> shorthand a little trickier (though
still possible). If you have comments or suggestions on this
issue, please let us know. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/issues/63">ISSUE-63</a>
</div>

<h3>The 'background-image' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-image</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td>[ <var>&lt;image&gt;</var> | none ]
        [ , [ <var>&lt;image&gt;</var> | none ] ]*
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified, but with URIs made absolute
</table>

<p>This property sets the background image(s) of an element. Images
are drawn with the first specified one on top (closest to the user)
and each subsequent image behind the previous one.

<p>A value of ''none'' counts as an image layer but draws
nothing. An image that is empty (zero width or zero height), that
fails to download, or that cannot be displayed (e.g., because it is
not in a supported image format) likewise counts as a layer but
draws nothing.

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-image' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

<div class="example">
<p>Some examples specifying background images:</p>
<pre>
body { background-image: url("marble.svg") }
p { background-image: none }
div { background-image: url(tl.png), url(tr.png) }
</pre>
</div>

<p class=note>Implementations may optimize by not downloading and
drawing images that are not visible (e.g., because they are behind
other, fully opaque images).

<h3>The 'background-repeat' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-repeat</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td><var>&lt;repeat&gt;</var> [ , <var>&lt;repeat&gt;</var> ]*
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>repeat
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified
</table>

<p>Specifies how background images are tiled after they have been
<a href="#the-background-size">sized</a> and <a href="#the-background-position">positioned</a>.
The type <dfn><var>&lt;repeat&gt;</var></dfn> stands for:
<pre class="rhs">repeat-x | repeat-y | [repeat | space | round | no-repeat]{1,2}</pre>

<p>Single values for <var>&lt;repeat&gt;</var> have the following
meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>repeat-x</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''repeat no-repeat''.

  <dt><dfn>repeat-y</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''no-repeat repeat''.

  <dt><dfn id="repeat-repeat">repeat</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''repeat repeat''.

  <dt><dfn id="no-repeat-no-repeat">no-repeat</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''no-repeat no-repeat''

  <dt><dfn id="space-space">space</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''space space''

  <dt><dfn id="round-round">round</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''round round''
</dl>

<p>If a <var>&lt;repeat&gt;</var> value has two keywords, the first
one is for the horizontal direction, the second for the vertical one,
as follows:

<p class="issue">Should "positioning area" be "painting area" here
or vice versa?</p>

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>repeat</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated in this direction as often as needed to cover
  the <a href="#bg-paint-area">background painting area</a>.

  <dt><dfn>no-repeat</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is placed once and not repeated in this direction.

  <dt><dfn>space</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated as often as will fit within the
  <a href="#bg-pos-area">background positioning area</a> without being
  clipped and then the images are spaced out to fill the area. The
  first and last images touch the edges of the area. If the background
  painting area is larger than the background positioning area, then
  the pattern repeats to fill the background painting area.
  The value of 'background-position' for this direction
  is ignored, unless there is not enough space for two copies of the
  image in this direction, in which case only one image is placed and
  'background-position' determines its position in this
  direction.

  <dt><dfn>round</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated as often as will fit within the <a
  href="#bg-pos-area">background positioning area</a>. If it doesn't
  fit a whole number of times, it is reduced in size until it does.
  See explanation under 'background-size'. If the background
  painting area is larger than the background positioning area, then
  the pattern repeats to fill the background painting area.
</dl>

<p>Unless one of the two keywords is ''no-repeat'', the
whole background painting area will be tiled, i.e., not just one
vertical strip and one horizontal strip.

<div class="example">
<p style="display:none">Example(s):
<pre>
body {
  background: white url("pendant.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-position: center;
}
</pre>

<div class="figure">
  <p><img src="bg-repeat" alt="A centered background image, with
  copies repeated up and down the border, padding and content
  areas."><!--<SPAN class="dlink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
  name="img-bg-repeat" href="images/longdesc/bg-repeat-desc.html"
  title="Long description for background pattern">[D]</A></SPAN>-->

  <p class="caption">The effect of ''repeat-y'': One copy
  of the background image is centered, and other copies are put above
  and below it to make a vertical band behind the element.
</div>
</div>

<div class=example>
  <p style="display:none">Example(s):
  <pre>
body {
  background-image: url(dot.png) white;
  background-repeat: space
}
</pre>

  <div class=figure>
    <p><img src="bg-space" alt="Image of an element with a dotted background">

    <p class=caption>The effect of 'space': the image of a dot is
    tiled to cover the whole background and the images are equally
    spaced.
  </div>
</div>

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-repeat' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

<h3>The 'background-attachment' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-attachment</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td>scroll | fixed | local [, scroll | fixed | local]*
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>scroll
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified
</table>

<p>If background images are specified, this property specifies whether
they are fixed with regard to the <em class="index">viewport</em>
(''fixed'') scroll along with the element (''scroll''
and ''local'').

<p>The difference between ''scroll'' and ''local'' is
only visible when the element has a scrolling mechanism (see the
'overflow' property [[!CSS21]]): in the case of
''scroll'', the background does not scroll with the element's
content. (It is attached to the element's border, as it were.) In the
case of ''local'', the background scrolls along with the element's
content. In this case, the background behind the element's border (if any)
scrolls as well, even though the border itself does not scroll with the
contents. The UA may, however, treat the ''no-clip'' and
''border-box'' values of 'background-clip' as
''padding-box'' in cases where 'background-attachment'
is ''local'' and the contents of the element scroll.

<p>Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible when it is in
the <a href="#bg-paint-area">background painting area</a> of the element
or otherwise unclipped. Thus, unless the image is tiled, it may be
invisible.

<div class="example">
<p>This example creates an infinite vertical band that remains
“glued” to the viewport when the element is scrolled.

<pre>
body {
  background: red url("pendant.gif");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>User agents that do not support ''fixed'' backgrounds (for
example due to limitations of the hardware platform) should ignore
declarations with the keyword ''fixed''. For example:

<pre class=example>
body {
   /* For all UAs: */
   background: white url(paper.png) scroll;
   /* For UAs that do fixed backgrounds: */
   background: white url(ledger.png) fixed;
}
h1 {
   /* For all UAs: */
   background: silver;
   /* For UAs that do fixed backgrounds: */
   background: url(stripe.png) fixed, white url(ledger.png) fixed;
}
</pre>

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-attachment' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

<h3>The 'background-position' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-position</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:

      <td><var>&lt;bg-position&gt;</var>
        [ , <var>&lt;bg-position&gt;</var> ]*
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>0% 0%
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>refer to size of background positioning area <em>minus</em> size of
        background image; see text
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>If one or two values are specified, for a &lt;length&gt; the
        absolute value, otherwise a percentage. If three or four values
        are specified, two pairs of a keyword plus a length or percentage.
</table>

<p>If background images have been specified, this property specifies
their initial position (after any <a href="#the-background-size">resizing</a>)
within their corresponding <a href="#bg-pos-area">background positioning area</a>.

<p class=syntax>The <dfn><var>&lt;bg-position&gt;</var></dfn> stands
for:
<pre class="rhs">[
  [ [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | left | center | right ] ]
  [ [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | top | center | bottom ] ]?
|
  [ center | [ left | right ] [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> ]? ] ||
  [ center | [ top | bottom ] [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> ]? ]
]</pre>

<p>If only one value is specified, the second value is assumed to be
'center'. If two values are given and at least one value is not a keyword,
then the first value represents the horizontal position (or offset) and
the second represents the vertical position (or offset). &lt;percentage&gt;
and &lt;length&gt; values here represent an offset of the top left corner
of the background image from the top left corner of the background
positioning area.

<p>If three or four values are given, then each &lt;percentage&gt; or
&lt;length&gt; represents an offset and must be preceded by a keyword,
which specifies from which edge the offset is given. For example,
''background-position: bottom 10px right 20px'' represents a
''10px'' vertical offset up from the bottom edge and a
''20px'' horizontal offset leftward from the right edge. If
three values are given, the missing offset is assumed to be zero.

<p>Positive values represent an offset <em>inward</em> from the edge of
the background positioning area. Negative values represent an offset
<em>outward</em> from the edge of the background positioning area.

<div class="example">
  <p>The following declarations give the stated (horizontal, vertical)
    offsets from the top left corner:</p>
  <pre>
   background-position: left 10px top 15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
   background-position: left      top     ;   /*  0px,  0px */
   background-position:      10px     15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
   background-position: left          15px;   /*  0px, 15px */
   background-position:      10px top     ;   /* 10px,  0px */
   background-position: left      top 15px;   /*  0px, 15px */
   background-position: left 10px top     ;   /* 10px,  0px */</pre>
</div>

<dl>
  <dt><dfn id="position-percentage">&lt;percentage&gt;</dfn>

  <dd><p>A percentage for the horizontal offset is relative to (<var>width
    background positioning area</var> - <var>width of background image</var>).
    A percentage for the vertical offset is relative to (<var>height background
    positioning area</var> - <var>height of background image</var>), where the
    size of the image is the size given by 'background-size'.
    <div class=example>
      <p>For example, with a value pair of ''0% 0%'', the upper left
      corner of the image is aligned with the upper left corner of, usually,
      the box's padding edge. A value pair of ''100% 100%'' places
      the lower right corner of the image in the lower right corner of the
      area. With a value pair of ''75% 50%'', the point 75% across
      and 50% down the image is to be placed at the point 75% across and 50%
      down the area.
      <div class="figure">
      <p><img alt="Diagram of image position within element" src="bg-pos.png">
      <p class="caption">Diagram of the meaning of ''background-position: 75% 50%''.
      </div>
    </div>

  <dt><dfn id="position-length">&lt;length&gt;</dfn>

  <dd>A length value gives a fixed length as the offset. For example, with a
    value pair of ''2cm 1cm'', the upper left corner of the image

  <dd>Equivalent to ''50%'' (''left 50%'') for the
    horizontal position if it is not otherwise given, or ''50%''
    (''top 50%'') for the vertical position if it is.

<p>Specifies the size of the background images. Values have the
following meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>contain</dfn></dt>
  <dd>Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio
    (if any), to the largest size such that both its width and its
    height can fit inside the <a href="#bg-pos-area">background
    positioning area</a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>cover</dfn></dt>
  <dd>Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio
    (if any), to the largest size such that both its width and its
    height can completely cover the background positioning area.</dd>

  <dt><dfn id="size-width-height">[ <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | auto ]{1,2}</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The first value gives the width of the corresponding image,
    the second value its height. If only one value is given the second
    is assumed to be ''auto''.

    <p>A percentage is relative to the background positioning area.

    <p>An ''auto'' value for one dimension is resolved by using the
    image's intrinsic ratio and the size of the other dimension, or
    failing that, using the image's intrinsic size, or failing that,
    treating it as 100%.

    <p>If both values are ''auto'' then the intrinsic width and/or
    height of the image should be used, if any, the missing dimension
    (if any) behaving as ''auto'' as described above. If the image has
    neither an intrinsic width nor an intrinsic height, its size is
    determined as for ''contain''.

    <p>Negative values are not allowed. A size of zero is allowed, but
    causes the image not to be displayed. (The effect is the same as
    if it had been a transparent image.)
  </dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
<p>Here are some examples. The first example stretches the background
image independently in both directions to completely cover the content
area:

<pre>
div {
    background-image: url(plasma.png);
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    background-origin: content-box }
</pre>

<p>The second example stretches the image so that exactly two copies
fit horizontally. The aspect ratio is preserved:

<pre>
p {
    background-image: url(tubes.png);
    background-size: 50% auto;
    background-origin: border-box }
</pre>

<p>This example forces the background image to be 15 by 15 pixels:

<pre>
para {
    background-size: 15px 15px;
    background-image: url(tile.png)}
</pre>

<p>This example uses the image's intrinsic size. Note that this is the
only possible behavior in CSS level&nbsp;1 and 2.

<pre>
body {
    background-size: auto;            /* default */
    background-image: url(flower.png) }
</pre>

<p>The following example rounds the height of the image to 25%, down
from the specified value of 30%. At 30%, three images would fit
entirely and a fourth only partially. After rounding, four images
fit. The width of the image is 20% of the background area width and is
not rounded.

<pre>
p {
    background-image: url(chain.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat round;
    background-size: 20% 30% }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If 'background-repeat' is ''round'' for one (or both) directions,
there is a second step. The UA must reduce the size in that direction
(or both directions) so that the image fits a whole number of times in
the background area. In the case of the width:

<blockquote>
  <p>If <var>X</var> &ne; 0 is the width of the image after step one
  and <var>W</var> is the width of the background area, then the
  rounded width <var>X'</var> = <var>W</var> / ceil(<var>W</var> /
  <var>X</var>)
</blockquote>

<p>The height is analogous. ceil() is a function that returns its
argument if it is a whole number, otherwise the next bigger whole
number.

<p>If 'background-repeat' is
''round'' for one direction only and if
'background-size' is
''auto'' for the other direction, then there is a third
step: that other direction is scaled so that the original aspect ratio
is restored.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example the background image is shown at its intrinsic size:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image1.png);
  background-repeat: repeat;         /* default */
  background-size: auto }            /* default */
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background is shown with a width of
3em and its height is scaled proportionally to keep the original
aspect ratio:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image2.png);
  background-repeat: repeat;         /* default */
  background-size: 3em }             /* = '3em auto' */
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background is shown with a width of
3em or slightly smaller, so that it fits a whole number of times in
the width of the background. The height is scaled proportionally to
keep the original aspect ratio:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image3.png);
  background-repeat: round repeat;
  background-size: 3em auto }
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background image is shown with a
width of 3em and a height that is either the height corresponding to
that width at the original aspect ratio or slightly less:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image4.png);
  background-repeat: repeat round;
  background-size: 3em auto }
</pre>
<p>In the following example, the background image is shown with a
height of 4em or slightly less, so that it fits a whole number of
times in the background height. The width is the width that correspond
to a 4em height at the original aspect ratio or slightly less:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image5.png);
  background-repeat: round;
  background-size: auto 4em }
</pre>
</div>

images”</a> for how 'background-clip' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

<h3>The 'background-break' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-break</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td>bounding-box | each-box | continuous

      <th>Initial:

      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>same as specified value
</table>

<p>This property applies to elements when they are broken into several
boxes (for example, across lines or across pages). It specifies how the
<a href="#bg-pos-area">background positioning area</a> is derived from
these multiple boxes and how the element's background is drawn within
them.

<p>Values have the following meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>bounding-box</dfn>

    <dd>The background positioning area is the smallest rectangle that
    encloses all broken boxes of the element.
    If the boxes are on different pages, the pages are treated as one
    continuous page&#8212;as if their page content areas were glued
    together in the block progression direction of the root element (i.e.
    glued together top to bottom for horizontal text mode)&#8212;and
    the rectangle drawn on this continuous page. If the page content
    areas have different widths, then they are aligned on the start edge
    (as defined by the properties applied to the root element). The
    background is only painted where indicated by 'background-clip'.

  <dt><dfn>each-box</dfn>

    <dd>The background is drawn independently in each box of the element.
    A no-repeat background image will thus be rendered once in each
    box of the element.

  <dt><dfn>continuous</dfn>

    <dd><p>The effect is as if, after the element has been laid out
    (including any justification, bidi reordering, page breaks, etc.),
    all the element's boxes are taken and put one after the other in
    visual order. The background is applied to the bounding box of
    this composite box and then the boxes are put back, with their
    share of the background.</p>

    <p>For boxes broken across lines, first boxes on the same line are
    connected in visual order. Then boxes on subsequent lines are
    ordered according to the <span class="issue">{containing
    block's | element's}</span> inline progression direction and
    aligned on the baseline.
    For example in a left-to-right containing block ('direction' is
    ''ltr''), the first box is the leftmost box on the first line and
    boxes from subsequent lines are put to the right of it. In a
    right-to-left containing block, the first box is the rightmost on
    the first line and subsequent boxes are put to the left of it.</p>

    <p>For boxes broken across columns, the the columns are treated as
    one continuous element, as if the column boxes were glued together
    in the block progression direction of the multi-column element.
    For boxes broken across pages, the page content areas are glued
    together in the block progression direction of the root element.
    In these cases, if the pieces have different widths (heights, if
    the root element / multi-column element is in vertical text mode),
    then each piece draws its background assuming that the
    whole element has the same width (height) as this piece. This
    ensures that right-aligned images stay aligned to the right edge,
    left-aligned images stay aligned to the left edge, and centered
    images stay centered.

<p class=note>Note that a color is permitted in
<var>&lt;final-bg-layer&gt;</var>, but not in <var>&lt;bg-layer&gt;</var>.

<p>The 'background' property is a
shorthand property for setting most background properties at the same
place in the style sheet. It sets each of
'background-color',
'background-position',
'background-size',
'background-repeat',
'background-origin',
'background-attachment' and
'background-image' to the value given, or to its initial value, if no
explicit value was specified. If the 'no-clip' keyword is present, it
sets 'background-clip' to that value. Otherwise if 'background-origin'
is present then it also sets 'background-clip' to that value, and if
not it sets 'background-clip' to its initial value.
I.e. <code>background: no-clip</code> sets 'background-clip' to 'no-clip' and
'background-origin' to its initial value. <code>background: border-box</code>
sets both 'background-origin' and 'background-clip' to 'border-box'.
The 'background' shorthand does not set 'background-break'.

<p>The ''::first-line'' pseudo-element is like an inline-level element
for the purposes of the background (see section 5.12.1 of [[!CSS21]]). 
That means, e.g., that in a left-justified first line, the background
does not necessarily extend all the way to the right margin.

<div class="example">
<p style="display:none">Examples:

<p>In the first rule of the following example, only a value for
'background-color' has been given and the
other individual properties are set to their initial values. In the
second rule, many individual properties have been specified.

<pre>
body { background: red }
p { background: url("chess.png") (10em) gray
       40% round fixed border border}
</pre>

<p>The first rule is equivalent to:

<pre>
body {
    background-color: red;
    background-position: 0% 0%;
    background-size: auto auto;
    background-repeat: repeat repeat;
    background-clip: border-box;
    background-origin: padding-box;
    background-attachment: scroll;
    background-image: none }
</pre>

<p>The second is equivalent to:

<pre>
p {
    background-color: gray;
    background-position: 40% 50%;
    background-size: 10em 10em;
    background-repeat: round round;
    background-clip: border-box;
    background-origin: border-box;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-image: url(chess.png) }

the full width of the element:

<pre>
E { background: #CCC url("metal.jpg") (100% auto) no-repeat top left }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Another example shows equivalence:

</div>

<div class=example>
<p>The following declaration with multiple, comma-separated values

<pre>
background: url(a.png) top left no-repeat,
            url(b.png) center (100% 100%) no-repeat,
            url(c.png) white;
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>
background-image:      url(a.png),  url(b.png),        url(c.png);
background-position:   top left,    center,            top left;
background-repeat:     no-repeat,   stretch no-repeat, repeat;
background-clip:       border-box,  border-box,        border-box;

background-attachment: scroll,      scroll,            scroll;
background-color:      white;
</pre>
</div>

<p class=note>Note that ''background: url(foo)
white'' and ''background: url(foo), white''
have the same effect.



<h3>The background of the canvas</h3>

<p>The background of the <em>root element</em> becomes the background
of the <em>canvas</em> and extends to cover the entire canvas,
although any images are positioned and stretched relative to the root
element as if they were painted for that element alone. If the root's
background-color value is ''transparent'', the
color is UA dependent. The root element does not paint this
background again.

<p>For <em>HTML documents,</em> however, it is recommended that
authors specify the background for the <code class=html>BODY</code>
element rather than the <code class=html>HTML</code> element. User
agents must observe the following precedence rules to fill in the
background of the canvas of HTML documents: if either or both of the
 'background-image' and
'background-color' properties on the <code
class=html>HTML</code> element is different from their initial values,
then use the background of the <code class=html>HTML</code> element,
else use the background of the <code class=html>BODY</code> element.
This does <em>not</em> apply to <span>XHTML documents.</span>

<div class="example">
<p>According to these rules, the canvas underlying the following HTML
document will have a “marble” background:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN'
  &gt;

<p>These properties set the style of the border, unless there is a
border image (see 'border-image').

<p>'Border-style' is a shorthand for the
other four. Its four values set the top, right, bottom and left border
respectively. A missing left is the same as right, a missing bottom is
the same as top, and a missing right is also the same as top.

<p class=syntax><var><dfn>&lt;border-style&gt;</dfn></var> is:
<pre class="rhs">none | hidden | dotted | dashed | solid | double | groove | ridge | inset | outset</pre>

<p>Values have the following meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn title="border-style-none">none</dfn>
  <dd>
  No border. Color and width are ignored (i.e., the border has width
  0, unless the border is an image, see
  'background-image'

  <dt><dfn>hidden</dfn>
  <dd>
  Same as 'none', but has different behavior in the conflict
  resolution rules for tables [[CSS3TBL]].

  <dt><dfn>dotted</dfn>
  <dd>
  A series of round dots.

  <dt><dfn>dashed</dfn>
  <dd>
  A series of square-ended dashes.

  <dt><dfn>solid</dfn>
  <dd>
  A single line segment.

  <dt><dfn>double</dfn>
  <dd>
  Two parallel solid lines with some space between them. (The
  thickness of the lines is not specified, but the sum of the lines
  and the space must equal
  'border-width'.)

  <dt><dfn>groove</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if it were carved in the canvas. (This is typically
  achieved by creating a “shadow” from two colors that are
  slightly lighter and darker than the
  'border-color'.)

  <dt><dfn>ridge</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if it were coming out of the canvas.

  <dt><dfn>inset</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if the content on inside of the border is sunken into the
  canvas. Different meaning on table[ref] elements.

  <dt><dfn>outset</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if the content on the inside of the border is coming out of
  the canvas. Different meaning for table[ref] elements.

<p>Borders are drawn in front of the element's background, but behind
the element's content (in case it overlaps).

<p>These properties set the thickness of the border.

<p class=syntax>The <dfn><var>&lt;border-width&gt;</var></dfn> is
<pre class="rhs"><var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | thin | medium | thick</pre>

<p>The <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> may not be
negative. The lengths corresponding to ''thin'', ''medium'' and
''thick'' are not specified, but the values are constant throughout a
<span>document</span> and thin &le; medium &le; thick. A UA could,
e.g., make the thickness depend on the ''medium'' font size: one
choice might be 1, 3 &amp; 5px when the 'medium' font size is 17px or
less.

<p>'Border-width' is a shorthand that sets the
four 'border-*-width' properties. If it has four values, they set top, right,
bottom and left in that order. If left is missing, it is the same as right;
if bottom is missing, it is the same as top; if right is missing, it is the
same as top.

<p class="note">Note that the initial width is 'medium', but the initial
style is 'none' and therefore the used width is 0.

<p>When the used width of the border is 0, we say that the border is
absent.

<p>Specifies an image to use instead of the border styles given by the
 'border-style' properties and an
additional background image for the element. If the value is
''none'' or if the image cannot be displayed, the
border styles will be used.

<p>The up to four numbers or percentages immediately following the
<var>&lt;image&gt;</var> specify which part of that image is used for
which part of the border. They divide the image into nine parts: four
corners, four edges and a middle part. The middle part is used as an
extra background image.

<p>The first of the four values is the height of the top edge and of
the two top corners. The second is the width of the right edge and the
two right corners. The third is the height of the bottom edge and the
two bottom corners. The fourth is the width of the left edge and the
two left corners.

<p>If the fourth number/percentage is absent, it is the same as the
second. If the third one is also absent, it is the same as the first. 
If the second one is also absent, it is the same as the first.

<p>Percentages are relative to the size of the image. Numbers
represent pixels in the image (if the image is a raster image) or CSS
px units (if not). Negative values are not allowed and values bigger
than the size of the image are interpreted as 100%.

<div class=figure>

  vertical cuts through an image">

  <p class=caption>Diagram illustrating the cuts corresponding to the
  value ''url("foo") 25% 30% 12% 20%''
</div>

<p>If the sum of the right and left widths is equal to
or greater than the width of the image, the images for the top and
bottom edge and the middle part are empty, which has the same effect
as if a nonempty transparent image had been specified for those
parts. Analogously for the top and bottom values.

<p>If the slash is present in the property value, the one to four
values after it are used for the width of the border
instead of the 'border-width' properties
(but only if the specified image can be displayed). The order of the
values is the same as for 'border-width'.

<p>At the end of the value, there may be up to two keywords, that
specify how the images for the sides and the middle part are scaled
and tiled. If the second is absent, it is assumed to be the same as
the first. If both are absent, the effect is the same as
''stretch stretch''.

<p>The nine images are scaled and tiled in four steps:

<dl>
<dt>step&nbsp;1
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li><p>The two images for the top and bottom edges are made as tall
  as the top and bottom borders, respectively, (either using
  'border-width' or the values specified after
  the slash) and their width is scaled proportionally.

  <li><p>The images for the left and right edge are made as wide as the
  left and right borders, respectively, and their height is scaled
  proportionally.

  <li><p>The corner images are scaled to be as wide and as tall as the two
  borders they are part of.

  <li><p>The middle image's width is scaled by the same factor as the top
  image unless that factor is zero or infinity, in which case the scaling
  factor of the bottom is substituted, and failing that, the width is not
  scaled. The height of the middle image is scaled by the same factor as
  the left image unless that factor is zero or infinity, in which case the
  scaling factor of the right image is substituted, and failing that, the
  height is not scaled.</p>
  <p class="issue">Clarify that failing means factor is zero or infinity</p>
  </ul>
<dt>step&nbsp;2
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''stretch'', the
  top, middle and bottom images are further scaled to be as wide as
  the element's padding box. The height is not changed any further.

  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''round'', the top,
  middle and bottom images are reduced in width, so that exactly a
  whole number of them fit in the width of the padding box, as
  follows:

  <blockquote>
    <p>If <var>X</var> &ne; 0 is the width of the image and
    <var>W</var> is the width of the padding area, then the rounded
    width <var>X'</var> = <var>W</var> / ceil(<var>W</var> /
    <var>X</var>)
  </blockquote>

  <li><p>If the first keyword is 'repeat', the top, middle, and bottom
    images are not changed any further.


  <li><p>The effects of ''stretch'', ''round'', and ''repeat'' for the
    second keyword are analogous, acting on the height of the left,
    middle and right images.
  </ul>

<dt>step&nbsp;3
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''round'', the top, middle, and bottom
    images are placed at the left edge of their respective parts of the
    border (the middle image is put in the padding area). Otherwise the
    images are centered horizontally in their respective areas.
  <li><p>If the second keyword is ''round'', the left, middle, and right
    images are placed at the top edge of their respective parts of the
    border/padding area. Otherwise the images are centered vertically
    in their respective areas.
  </ul>

<dt>step&nbsp;4
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li><p>The images are then tiled within their respective areas. All
    images are drawn behind the element's content, in front of the
     element's background.
  </ul>
</dl>

<div class=example>
<p>This example creates a top and bottom border consisting of a whole
number of orange diamonds and a left and right border of a single,
stretched diamond. The corners are diamonds of a different color. The
image to tile is as follows. Apart from the diamonds, it is
transparent:

<p><img src="border.png" alt="Tile for border">

<p>The image is 81 by 81 pixels and has to be divided into 9 equal
parts. The style rules could thus be as follows:

<pre>
DIV {
  border-image: url("border.png") 27 round stretch;
  border: double orange 1em }
</pre>

<p>The result, when applied to a DIV of 12 by 5em, will be similar to
this:

<p><img src="borderresult.png" alt="element with a diamond border">
</div>

<p>The 'border-image' property does not
apply to table elements in a table with
'border-collapse' set to
''collapse''.

<p>The two length values of the 'border-*-radius' properties define
the radii of a quarter ellipse that defines the shape of the corner
of the outer border edge (see the diagram below).
The first value is the horizontal radius. If the
second length is omitted it is equal to the first (and the corner is
thus a quarter circle). If either length is zero, the corner is
square, not rounded.

<p>The 'border-radius' shorthand sets all four 'border-*-radius'
properties. If values are given before and after the slash, then
the values before the slash set the horizontal radius and the values
after the slash set the vertical radius. If there is no slash, then the
values set both radii equally. The four values for each radii are
given in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.
If bottom-left is omitted it is the same as top-right. If
bottom-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. If top-right is
omitted it is the same as top-left.

<div class="example">
<pre>
border-radius: 4em;
</pre>
would be equivalent to
<pre>
border-top-left-radius:     4em;
border-top-right-radius:    4em;
border-bottom-right-radius: 4em;
border-bottom-left-radius:  4em;
</pre>
and
<pre>
border-radius: 2em 1em 4em / 0.5em 3em;
</pre>
would be equivalent to
<pre>
border-top-left-radius:     2em 0.5em;
border-top-right-radius:    1em 3em;
border-bottom-right-radius: 4em 0.5em;
border-bottom-left-radius:  1em 3em;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The padding edge (inner border) radius is the outer border radius
minus the corresponding border thickness. In the case where this results
in a negative value, the inner radius is zero. (In such cases its center
might not coincide with that of the outer border curve.)

<p>Backgrounds, but not the <a
href="#the-border-image">border-image</a>, are clipped to the inner,
resp., outer curve of the border if 'background-clip' is
''padding-box'' resp., ''border-box''. Other effects that clip to the
border or padding edge (such as 'overflow') also must clip to the
curve.

<p class="note">It is recommended that the UA style sheet apply
<code>overflow: hidden</code> to elements (such as the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
element in HTML) that are expected to be replaced elements so that
their corners automatically trim to the border radius.</p>

<p>When two adjoining borders are
of different thicknesses the corner will show a smooth transition
between the thicker and thinner borders. One of the borders may even
have zero width.

<p>The center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders
is at the point on the curve that is at an angle that is proportional
to the ratio of the border widths. For example, if the two widths are
equal, that point is at a 45&deg; angle, and if one is twice the width
of the other the point is at a 30&deg; angle. The line demarcating this
transition is drawn between the point at that angle on the outer curve
and the point at that angle on the inner curve. The transition must be
contained within the segment of the border where the tangent of the
inner curve either not defined or is not parallel with the sides of the
box. It is not defined what the transition looks like, but a gradient
is recommended for color transitions that don't involve dotted or dashed
borders.

  <p class=caption>The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders

</div>

<p>All border styles ( ''solid'', ''dotted'',  ''inset'', etc.)
follow the curve of the border.

<p>Corners do not overlap: When the sum of two adjacent corner radii
exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must reduce one or more of the
radii. The algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:

<p>The sum of two adjacent radii may not be more than the width or
height (whichever is relevant) of the box. If any sum exceeds that
value, all radii are reduced according to the following formula: Let
<var>f</var> = min(<var>L<sub>i</sub></var>/<var>S<sub>i</sub></var>),
where <var>i</var> ∈ {top, right, bottom, left},
<var>S<sub>i</sub></var> is the sum of the radii of the corners on
side <var>i</var>, and <var>L<sub>top</sub></var> =
<var>L<sub>bottom</sub></var> = the width of the box, and
<var>L<sub>left</sub></var> = <var>L<sub>right</sub></var> = the
height of the box. If <var>f</var> < 1, then all corner radii are
reduced by multiplying them by <var>f</var>.

<p class=note>Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles
remain quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller
ones, but it may reduce corners that were already small enough, which
may make borders of nearby elements that should look the same look
different.

<div class=example>
<p>For example, the borders A and D of the <a
href="#reduced-radius">figure below</a> might be the
result of
<pre>
box-width: border-box;
width: 6em;
height: 2.5em;
border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em
</pre>
<p>The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus
2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em,
<pre>
box-width: border-box;
width: 6em;
height: 2em;
border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em
</pre>
<p>all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make
them fit. The used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and
1.6em (instead of 2em). See borders B and C in the figure.

<div class=figure id=reduced-radius>
  <p><img src="corner-large-mix" alt="[image: rectangle with two tiny
  rounded corners and two very large ones, on opposite corners]">

  <p class=caption>These rounded corner might be the result of 'width:
  6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em' for A and
  D; and ditto but with 'height: 2em' for B and C.
</div>
</div>

<p>The UA may apply the border-radius properties to ''table'' and
''inline-table'' elements when 'border-collapse' is ''collapse'' but is
not required to. In this case not only must the border radii of adjacent
corners not intersect, but the horizontal and vertical radii of a single
corner may not extend past the boundaries of the cell at that corner
(i.e. the cell's other corners must not be affected by this corner's
border-radius). If the computed values of the border radii would cause
this effect, then the used values of all the border radii of the table
must be reduced by the same factor so that the radii neither intersect
nor extend past the boundaries of their respective corner cells.

<p>The CSS3 UAs should ignore border-radius properties applied to internal
table elements when 'border-collapse' is ''collapse''.
The effect of border-radius on internal table elements is undefined in
CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders, but may be defined in a future specification.

<p>The UA may reduce or treat as zero the border-radius for a given corner
if a scrolling mechanism is present in that corner.</p>

<div class=example>
<p>This example draws ovals of 15em wide and 10em high:

<pre>
DIV.standout {
    width: 13em;
    height: 8em;
    border: solid black 1em;
    border-radius: 7.5em 5em }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>This example adds appropriate padding, so that the
contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border,
but the background will still have rounded corners.

<pre>
DIV {
    background: black;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 1em;
    padding: 1em }
</pre>
</div>

<p>When a box that has a border is broken at a page break, column
break, or, for inline elements, at a line break, a border and some
padding can be inserted at the break, or the border can be left open.

<p>If the value of 'border-break' is ''close'', then each box is
independently wrapped with the border and padding.

<p>If the style is set to ''none'', no border and no padding are
inserted at the break.

<p>Otherwise, padding is added as wide as the corresponding side of
the 'padding' property and a border is added with the specified style,
width, and color.

<p class="note">Note this means that padding is added if the border
style is ''hidden'', but not if the border style is ''none''.

<p>This is a shorthand property for setting the width, style, and

<p>The 'border' property is a shorthand
property for setting the same width, color, and style for all
four borders of a box. Unlike the shorthand
'margin' and
'padding' properties, the
'border' property cannot set different values
on the four borders. To do so, one or more of the other border
properties must be used.

<div class="example">
<p>For example, the first rule below is equivalent to the set of four
rules shown after it:

<pre>
p { border: solid red }
p {
  border-top: solid red;
  border-right: solid red;
  border-bottom: solid red;
  border-left: solid red;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Since, to some extent, the properties have overlapping
functionality, the order in which the rules are specified is
important.

<div class="example">
<p>Consider this example:
<pre>
blockquote {
  border-color: red;
  border-left: double;
  color: black
}
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the color of the left border is black, while
the other borders are red. This is due to
'border-left' setting the width, style, and
color. Since the color value is not given by the
'border-left' property, it will be taken from
the 'color' property. The fact that the
'color' property is set after the
'border-left' property is not relevant.
</div>

<h3 id="the-box-shadow">The 'box-shadow' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>
  <tr>
    <th>Name:
    <td><dfn>box-shadow</dfn>
  <tr>
    <th>Value:
    <td>none | <var>&lt;shadow&gt;</var> [ , <var>&lt;shadow&gt;</var> ]*
  <tr>
    <th>Initial:
    <td>none

    <td>all elements

    <th>Inherited:
    <td>no

    <td>visual
  <tr>
    <th>Computed value:
    <td>any &lt;length&gt; made absolute; any color computed; otherwise as specified
</table>

<p>The 'box-shadow' property attaches one or more drop-shadows
to the box. The property is a comma-separated list of shadows, each specified
by 2-4 length values, an optional color, and an optional ''inset''
keyword. Omitted lengths are 0, omitted colors are a UA-chosen color.

<p>The type <dfn><var>&lt;shadow&gt;</var></dfn> stands for:
<pre class="rhs">
inset || [ <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>? <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>? || <var>&lt;color&gt;</var> ]</pre>
<p>where the first two lengths are required. The components of each
<var>&lt;shadow&gt;</var> are interpreted as follows:

<ul>
  <li>The first length is the horizontal offset of the shadow. A
  positive value draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the
  box, a negative length to the left.

  <li>The second length is the vertical offset. A positive value
  offsets the shadow down, a negative one up.

  <li>The third length is a blur radius. Negative values are not
  allowed. If it is 0, the shadow is sharp, otherwise the larger the
  value, the more the shadow is blurred. The exact algorithm is not
  specified.

  <li>The fourth length is a spread radius. Positive values cause
  the shadow to grow in all directions by the specified radius.
  Negative values cause the shadow to shrink. The shadow should not
  change shape when a spread radius is applied: sharp corners should
  remain sharp.

  <li>The color is the color of the shadow.

  <li>The ''inset'' keyword, if present, changes the drop
  shadow from an outer shadow (one that shadows the box onto the
  canvas, as if it were lifted above the canvas) to an inner shadow
  (one that shadows the canvas onto the box, as if the box were cut
  out of the canvas and shifted behind it).
  <span class="issue">Should this keyword be called "inner" instead?</span>
</ul>

<p>An outer box-shadow casts a shadow as if the border-box of the element
were opaque. The shadow is drawn outside the border edge only: it is
not drawn inside the border-box of the element.

<p>An inner box-shadow casts a shadow as if everything outside the padding
edge were opaque. The inner shadow is drawn inside the padding edge only:
it is not drawn in outside the padding box of the element.

<p>If the box has a nonzero <span class="property">'border-radius'</span>,
the shadow is rounded in the same way. If an element has multiple boxes,
all of them get drop shadows, but shadows are only drawn where borders
would also be drawn, see 'border-break'.

<p>The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is
on top and the others are layered behind. Shadows do not influence
layout and may overlap other boxes or their shadows. In terms of stacking
contexts and the painting order, the outer shadows of an element are drawn
immediately below the background of that element, and the inner shadows of
an element are drawn immediately above the background of that element
(below the borders and border-image, if any).

  being given a drop shadow.</p>

<h3 id=conformance>Conformance</h3>

<p>A <span>UA</span> conforms to this module if it satisfies the rules
given next. However, it is recommended that UAs try to conform to one
of the levels (1, 2 or 3) or profiles ([[CSS-MOBILE]], [[CSS-PRINT]],
etc.) of CSS, rather than to individual modules.

<p>A UA that renders <span title=document>documents</span> must
interpret CSS style sheets according to the generic CSS grammar
[[!CSS3SYN]] and the individual grammars of each property in this
module, it must understand at least type selectors [[!SELECT]], it
must apply the rules of cascading and inheritance [[!CSS3CASCADE]],
and it must render documents as defined for each property in this
module.

<p>A UA that writes style sheets, must write syntactically correct
style sheets, according to the generic CSS grammar [[!CSS3SYN]] and
the individual grammars of each property in this module.

<p>The inability of a UA to correctly render a document due to
limitations of the device does not make the UA non-conformant. (For
example, a UA cannot render color on a monochrome monitor.)



<h3>Glossary</h3>

<p>The following terms and abbreviations are used in this
module.

<dl>
<dt><dfn>UA</dfn>
<dt><dfn>User Agent</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A program that reads and/or writes CSS style sheets on behalf of a
user in either or both of these categories: programs whose purpose is
to render <span title=document>documents</span> (e.g., browsers) and
programs whose purpose is to create style sheets (e.g., editors). A UA
may fall into both categories. (There are other programs that read or
write style sheets, but this module gives no rules for them.)

<dt><dfn>document</dfn>
<dt><dfn>source document</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A tree-structured document with elements and attributes, such as an
SGML or XML document [[XML11]].

<dt><dfn>HTML document</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A document that has the MIME type text/html [[RFC2854]] and
conforms to that type.

<dt><dfn>XHTML document</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A document that has the MIME type text/xhtml+xml or
application/xhtml+xml [[RFC3236]] and conforms to either type.

<dt><dfn>style sheet</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A document conforming to the generic CSS grammar [[!CSS3SYN]].

<h3 id="exit">CR exit criteria</h3>

<p>As described in the W3C process document, a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate
Recommendation</a> (CR) is a specification that W3C recommends for use
on the Web. The next stage is “Recommendation,” when the
specification is sufficiently implemented.

<p>For this specification to be proposed as a W3C Recommendation, the
following conditions shall be met:
<ol>
  <li><p>There must be at least two interoperable implementations for
  every feature in the Module. For the purposes of this criterion, we
  define the following terms:
  <dl>
    <dt>feature

      <dd><p>a section or subsection of the specification

    <dt>interoperable

      <dd><p>passing the respective test case(s) in the CSS test
      suite, or, if the implementation is not a web browser, an
      equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test suite should
      have an equivalent test created if such a UA is to be used to
      claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used
      to claim interoperability, then there must one or more
      additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent tests in the
      same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent
      tests must be made publicly available for the purposes of peer
      review.

    <dt>implementation

      <dd><p>a user agent which:
      <ol>
        <li>implements the feature.

        <li>is available (i.e. publicly downloadable or available
        through some other public point of sale mechanism). This is
        the "show me" requirement.

        <li>is shipping (i.e. development, private or unofficial
        versions are insufficient).

        <li>is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide audience
        and could be used on a daily basis.)
      </ol>
  </dl>

  <li><p>A minimum of sixth months of the CR period must have elapsed.
  This is to ensure that enough time is given for any remaining major
  errors to be caught.

  <li><p>Features will be dropped if two or more interoperable
  implementations are not found by the end of the CR period.

  <li><p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by
  judgment of CSS WG) tests have not been produced for those
  feature(s) by the end of the CR period.
</ol>



<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Tapas Roy was editor of the Border Module, before it was merged
with the Background Module.

<p>A set of properties for border images was initially proposed by
<em>fantasai.</em> The current simplification (one image cut into nine
parts) is due to Ian Hickson. (Though the original idea seems to
originate with some anonymous Microsoft engineers.)

<p>Thanks to Ben Stucki for defining what happens with rounded corners
if the two adjoining borders are of unequal thickness or one of them
is zero; to Arjan Eising and Anne van Kesteren for the 'border-radius'
syntax.

<p>Emrah Baskaya and <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Aug/0001.html">
Simon Pieters</a> were among the people who argued for a fallback
color (see 'background-color'), which is only shown when any specified
image(s) cannot be loaded.

<p>Finally, special thanks go to Brad Kemper for his feedback and
suggestions for many of the features in the draft, and for drawing
all the box-shadow examples.</p>
