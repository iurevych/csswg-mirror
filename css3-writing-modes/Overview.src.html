Introduction to Writing Modes</h2>

  <p>CSS3 Writing Modes defines CSS features to support for various international
    writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. Latin or Indic), right-to-left
    (e.g. Hebrew or Arabic), bidirectional (e.g. mixed Latin and Arabic) and
    vertical (e.g. Asian scripts).</p>

  <p>A <dfn>writing mode</dfn> in CSS is determined by the 'writing-mode',
    'direction', and 'text-orientation' properties. It is defined primarily
    in terms of its <i>inline base direction</i> and <i>block flow
    direction</i>:

  <div class="sidebar">

    </div>
    <div class="figure left">

          alt="Mongolian-based writing mode"></a>
      <p class="caption">Mongolian-based writing mode
    </div>
    <div class="figure right">
      <a href="diagrams/text-flow-vectors-tb.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
        <img src="diagrams/text-flow-vectors-tb.png" class="landscape"
          alt="Han-based writing mode"></a>
      <a href="diagrams/text-flow-vectors-rl.svg" type="image/svg+xml">

          alt="Han-based writing mode"></a>
      <p class="caption">Han-based writing mode
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <dfn>inline base direction</dfn> is the primary direction in which
    content is ordered on a line and defines on which sides the "start"
    and "end" of a line are. The 'direction' property specifies the
    inline base direction of an element and, together with the 'unicode-bidi'
    property and the inherent directionality of any text content, determines
    the ordering of inline-level content within a line.

  <p>The <dfn>block flow direction</dfn> is the direction in which
    block-level boxes stack  and the direction in which line boxes stack
    within a block container. The 'writing-mode' property determines the
    block flow direction.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>horizontal writing mode</dfn> is one with horizontal lines of
    text, i.e. a downward or upward block flow. A <dfn>vertical writing
    mode</dfn> is one with vertical lines of text, i.e. a leftward or
    rightward block flow.

  <p class="note">These terms should not be confused with
    <dfn>vertical block flow</dfn> (which is a downward or
    upward block flow) and <dfn>horizontal block flow</dfn> (which is
    leftward or rightward block flow). To avoid confusion, CSS
    specifications avoid this latter set of terms.</p>

  <p>Writing systems typically have one or two native writing modes. Some
    examples are:
  <ul>
    <li>Latin-based systems are typically written using a left-to-right inline
      direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.
    <li>Arabic-based systems are typically written using a right-to-left
      inline direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.
    <li>Mongolian-based systems are typically written using a top-to-bottom
      inline direction with a rightward (left-to-right) block flow direction.
    <li>Han-based systems are commonly written using a left-to-right inline direction
      with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction, <strong>or</strong>
      a top-to-bottom inline direction with a leftward (right-to-left) block
      flow direction. Many magazines and newspapers will mix these two writing
      modes on the same page.
  </ul>

  <p>The 'text-orientation' component of the writing mode determines the
    <i>line orientation</i> and the <i>typesetting mode</i>, and controls
    details of text layout such as the <i>glyph orientation</i>.

Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module replaces and extends the 'unicode-bidi' and 'direction'
  features defined in [[!CSS21]] sections 8.6 and 9.10.

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
  descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
  letters in this specification.
  
  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
  
  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
  or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
  like this:
  
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
  normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
  
  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.


<h2 id="text-direction">
Inline Direction and Bidirectionality</h2>

  <p>While the characters in most scripts are written from left to right,
    certain scripts are written from right to left. In some documents,
    in particular those written with the Arabic  or Hebrew script, and in
    some mixed-language contexts, text in a single (visually displayed)
    block may appear with mixed directionality. This phenomenon is called
    <span class="index-def" title="bidirectionality (bidi)"><dfn>bidirectionality</dfn></span>, or
    "bidi" for short.</p>

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img src="diagrams/bidi.png"
            alt="An example of bidirectional text is a Latin name in an Arabic
                 sentence. The sentence overall is typeset right-to-left, but
                 the letters in the Latin word in the middle are typeset
                 left-to-right.">
    <p class="caption">Bidirectionality</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Unicode standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9</a>) defines a complex
    algorithm for determining the proper ordering of bidirectional text. The
    algorithm consists of an implicit part based on character properties,
    as well as explicit controls for embeddings and overrides. CSS relies
    on this algorithm to achieve proper bidirectional rendering. The <span
    class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span> and <span
    class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> properties allow
    authors to specify how the elements and attributes of a document
    language map to this algorithm.</p>

  <p>User agents that support bidirectional text must apply the Unicode
    bidirectional algorithm to every sequence of inline-level boxes uninterrupted
    by a forced (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Bidirectional_Character_Types">bidi class B</a>)
    paragraph break or block boundary. This sequence forms the <dfn>paragraph</dfn>
    unit in the bidirectional algorithm.
    
  <p>Except when the ''plaintext'' value of 'unicode-bidi' is in effect,
    the paragraph embedding level is set according to the value of the
    'direction' property of the paragraph's element rather than by the
    heuristic given in steps P2 and P3 of the Unicode algorithm. The
    paragraph's element is usually the containing block, but in the case
    of a paragraph contained by bidi <a href="#isolate">isolation</a> it
    is the isolating inline element instead.

  <p>Because the base directionality of a text depends on the structure and
    semantics of the document, the 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties
    should in most cases be
    used only to map bidi information in the markup to its corresponding
    CSS styles. If a document language provides markup features to control
    bidi, authors and users should use those features and not specify CSS
    rules to override them.</p>

  <p>The HTML 4 specification ([[HTML401]], section 8.2) defines
    bidirectionality behavior for HTML elements. The HTML 4 specification
    also contains more information on bidirectionality issues.</p>

  <p class="note">Because HTML UAs can turn off CSS styling, we advise HTML 
    authors to use the HTML 'dir' attribute and &lt;bdo&gt; element to
    ensure correct bidirectional layout in the absence of a style sheet.</p>  

<h3 id="direction">
Specifying Directionality: the 'direction' property</h3>

  <table class="propdef">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Name:</th>
        <td><dfn>direction</dfn></td>

        <td>specified value</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>This property specifies the base directionality of text and elements
    on a line, and the directionality of embeddings and overrides (see
    'unicode-bidi') for the Unicode
    bidirectional algorithm. In addition, it affects the ordering of <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html">table</a> column layout,
    the direction of horizontal <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#overflow">overflow</a>,
    and the default alignment of text within a line, and other things
    that depend on the base inline base direction.</p>

  <p>Values for this property have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn>ltr</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Left-to-right directionality.</dd>
   <dt><dfn>rtl</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Right-to-left directionality.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">The 'direction' property has no effect on bidi reordering
    when specified on inline elements whose 'unicode-bidi' property's
    value is ''normal''.</p>

  <p>The value of the 'direction' property on the root element is also
    propagated to the initial containing block and, together with the
    'writing-mode' property, determines the document's principal writing
    mode. (See <a href="#principal-writing-mode">below</a>.)

  <p class="note">Note that the 'direction' property of the HTML BODY
    element is <em>not</em> propagated to the viewport. That special
    behavior only applies to the background and overflow properties.

  <p class="note">The 'direction'
     property, when specified for table column elements, is not inherited by
     cells in the column since columns are not the ancestors of the cells in
     the document tree. Thus, CSS cannot easily capture the "dir" attribute
     inheritance rules described in [[HTML401]], section 11.3.2.1.

<h3 id="unicode-bidi">
Embeddings and Overrides: the 'unicode-bidi' property</h3>

    <table class="propdef">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Name:</th>
          <td><dfn>unicode-bidi</dfn></td>

          <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
          <td>specified value</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <p>Values for this property have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>normal</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The element does not open an additional level of embedding with
      respect to the bidirectional algorithm. For inline elements,
      implicit reordering works across element boundaries.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>embed</dfn></dt>
    <dd>If the element is inline, this value opens an additional level
      of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.
      The direction of this embedding level is given by the 'direction'
      property. Inside the element, reordering is done implicitly. This
      corresponds to adding a LRE (U+202A), for 'direction: ltr', or RLE
      (U+202B), for 'direction: rtl', at the start of the element and a PDF
      (U+202C) at the end of the element.
      <span class="note">This value has no effect on elements that are
      not inline.</span></dd>
    <dt><dfn>isolate</dfn></dt>
    <dd>For the purposes of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, the
      contents of the element are considered to be inside a separate,
      independent paragraph with a base directionality given by the
      element's 'direction' property, and for the purpose of bidi resolution
      in its containing bidi paragraph (if any), the element itself is
      treated as if it were an Object Replacement Character (U+FFFC).
      (If the element is broken across multiple lines, then each box
      of the element is treated as an Object Replacement Character.)</dd>
    <dt><dfn>bidi-override</dfn></dt>
    <dd>For inline elements this creates an override. For block-container
      elements this creates an override for inline-level descendants not
      within another block container element. This means that inside the
      element, reordering is strictly in sequence according to the
      'direction' property; the implicit part of the bidirectional algorithm
      is ignored. This corresponds to adding a LRO (U+202D), for ''direction:
      ltr'', or RLO (U+202E), for ''direction: rtl'', at the start of the
      element and a PDF (U+202C) at the end of the element.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>plaintext</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>For the purposes of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, the
      base directionality of each bidi paragraph for which the element
      forms the containing block is determined not by the element's
      computed 'direction' as usual, but by following the heuristic in
      rules P2 and P3 of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm.
      For inline elements, this value behaves as for ''isolate'',
      except, as with block containers, the base directionality is
      determined by following the Unicode heuristic instead of by using
      the 'direction' value.
  </dl>

  <p>The final order of characters within in each bidi paragraph is the
    same as if the bidi control codes had been added as described above,
    markup had been stripped, and the resulting character sequence had
    been passed to an implementation of the Unicode bidirectional
    algorithm for plain text that produced the same line-breaks as the
    styled text.

  <p>In this process, replaced elements with 'display: inline' are treated
    as neutral characters, unless their 'unicode-bidi' property has a
    value other than 'normal', in which case they are treated as strong
    characters in the 'direction' specified for the element.
    All other atomic inline-level boxes are treated as neutral characters
    always.</p>

  <p>If an inline element is broken around a bidi paragraph
    boundary (e.g. if split by a block or forced paragraph break), then
    the bidi control codes corresponding to the end of the element are
    added before the interruption and the codes corresponding to the
    start of the element are added after it. (In other words, any embedding
    levels or overrides started by the element are closed at the paragraph
    break and reopened on the other side of it.)

  <p>Because the Unicode algorithm has a limit of 
    <em title="According to unicode 3.0, chapter 3, section 12, definition BD2. 
    Specifically, page 58 here: http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch03.pdf">
    61 levels</em> of embedding, care should be taken not to use <span
    class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> with a value other
    than 'normal' unless appropriate. In particular, a value of 'inherit'
    should be used with extreme caution. However, for elements that are,
    in general, intended to be displayed as blocks, a setting of
    'unicode-bidi: isolate' is preferred to keep the element together in
    case display is changed to inline (see example below).</p>

<h3 id="bidi-example">
Example of Bidirectional Text</h3>

  <p>The following example shows an XML document with bidirectional
    text. It illustrates an important design principle: document language
    designers should take bidi into account both in the language proper
    (elements and attributes) and in any accompanying style sheets. The
    style sheets should be designed so that bidi rules are separate from
    other style rules, and such rules should not be overridden by other
    style sheets so that the document language's bidi behavior is preserved.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <p>In this example, lowercase letters stand for inherently left-to-right
      characters and uppercase letters represent inherently right-to-left
      characters. The text stream is shown in logical backing store order.</p>

    <pre class="xml-example"><code class="xml">
&lt;HEBREW&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;HEBREW1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 HEBREW5&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;HEBREW6 &lt;EMPH&gt;HEBREW7&lt;/EMPH&gt; HEBREW8&lt;/PAR&gt;
&lt;/HEBREW&gt;
&lt;ENGLISH&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english9 english10 english11 HEBREW12 HEBREW13&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english14 english15 english16&lt;/PAR&gt;
  &lt;PAR&gt;english17 &lt;HE-QUO&gt;HEBREW18 english19 HEBREW20&lt;/HE-QUO&gt;&lt;/PAR&gt;
&lt;/ENGLISH&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Since this is arbitrary XML, the style sheet is responsible for
      setting the writing direction. This is the style sheet:</p>

    <pre>
/* Rules for bidi */
HEBREW, HE-QUO  {direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;}
ENGLISH         {direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed;} 

/* Rules for presentation */
HEBREW, ENGLISH, PAR  {display: block;}
EMPH                  {font-weight: bold;}
    </pre>

    <p>The HEBREW element is a block with a right-to-left base direction,
      the ENGLISH element is a block with a left-to-right base
      direction. The PARs are blocks that inherit the base direction from
      their parents. Thus, the first two PARs are read starting at the top
      right, the final three are read starting at the top left.  Please note
      that HEBREW and ENGLISH are chosen as element names for explicitness
      only; in general, element names should convey structure without
      reference to language.</p>

    <p>The EMPH element is inline-level, and since its value for <span
      class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> is 'normal' (the
      initial value), it has no effect on the ordering of the text. The
      HE-QUO element, on the other hand, creates an embedding.</p>

    <p>The formatting of this text might look like this if the line length

<h3 id="bidi-box-model">
Box model for inline elements in bidirectional context</h3>

  <p>Since bidi reordering can split apart and reorder text that is
    logically contiguous, bidirectional text can cause an inline boxes
    to be split and reordered within a line.

  <p class="note">Note that in order to be able to flow inline boxes in a
    uniform direction (either entirely left-to-right or entirely
    right-to-left), anonymous inline boxes may have to be created.</p>

<!-- CSS2.1 8.6 -->
  <p>For each line box, UAs must take the inline boxes generated for each
    element and render the margins, borders and padding in visual order
    (not logical order). The <i>start</i>-most box on the first line box
    in which the element appears has the <i>start</i> edge's margin, border,
    and padding; and the end-most box on the last line box in which the
    element appears has the <i>end</i> edge's margin, border, and padding.
    For example, in the ''horizontal-tb'' writing mode:
    <ul>
      <li>When the parent's 'direction' property is ''ltr'', the left-most
      generated box of the first line box in which the element appears
      has the left margin, left border and left padding, and the right-most
      generated box of the last line box in which the element appears has
      the right padding, right border and right margin.
      <li>When the parent's 'direction' property is ''rtl'', the right-most
      generated box of the first line box in which the element appears has
      the right padding, right border and right margin, and the left-most
      generated box of the last line box in which the element appears has
      the left margin, left border and left padding.
    </ul>
    <p>Analogous rules hold for vertical writing modes.</p>

  <p class="note">The 'box-decoration-break' property can override this
    behavior to draw box decorations on both sides of each box. [[!CSS3BG]] </p>

<h2 id="vertical-intro">
Introduction to Vertical Text</h2>

  <p><em>This subsection is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>In addition to extensions to CSS2.1&rsquo;s support for bidirectional text,
    this module introduces the rules and properties needed to support vertical
    text layout in CSS.

  <p>Unlike languages that use the Latin script which are primarily laid out
    horizontally, Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese can be laid out
    vertically.  The Japanese example below shows the same text laid out
    horizontally and vertically. In the horizontal case, text is read
    from left to right, top to bottom. For the vertical case, the text is
    read top to bottom, right to left.
    Indentation from the left edge in the left-to-right horizontal case
    translates to indentation from the top edge in the top-to-bottom vertical
    case.

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img src="vert-horiz-comparison.png"
            alt="A comparison of horizontal and vertical Japanese shows that
                 although the lines rotate, the characters remain upright.
                 Some glyphs, however change: a period mark shifts from the
                 bottom left of its glyph box to the top right. Running
                 headers, however, may remain
                 laid out horizontally across the top of the page."></p>
    <p class="caption">Comparison of vertical and horizontal Japanese: iBunko application (iOS)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">For Chinese and Japanese lines are ordered either right
    to left or top to bottom, while for Mongolian and Manchu lines are
    ordered left to right.</p>

  <p>The change from horizontal to vertical writing can affect not just the
    layout, but also the typesetting. For example, the position of a punctuation
    mark within its spacing box can change from the horizontal to the
    vertical case, and in some cases alternate glyphs are used.

  <p>Vertical text that includes Latin script text or text from other scripts
    normally displayed horizontally can display that text in a number of
    ways. For example, Latin words can be rotated sideways, or each letter
    can be oriented upright:

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img src="vert-latin-layouts.png"
            alt="A dictionary definition for &#x30F4;&#x30A3;&#x30EB;&#x30B9;
                 might write the English word 'virus' rotated 90&deg; clockwise,
                 but stack the letters of the initialisms 'RNA' and 'DNA' upright."></p>
    <p class="caption">Examples of Latin in vertical Japanese: Daijirin Viewer 1.4 (iOS)</</p>
  </div>

  <p>In some special cases such as two-digit numbers in dates, text is fit
    compactly into a single vertical character box:

  <div class="figure" id="fig-mac">
    <p><img src="vert-number-layouts.png"
            alt="An excerpt from MacFan shows several possible vertical layouts
                 for numbers: the two-digit month and day are written as
                 horizontal-in-vertical blocks; the years are written with
                 each character upright; except in the English phrase
                 &ldquo;for Mac 2011&rdquo;, where the date is rotated to
                 match the rotated Latin."></p>
    <p class="caption">Mac Fan, December 2010, p.49</p>
  </div>

  <p>Layouts often involve a mixture of vertical and horizontal elements:

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img src="vert-horiz-combination.png"
            alt="Magazines often mix horizontal and vertical layout; for
                 example, using one orientation for the main article text
                 and a different one for sidebar or illustrative content."></p>
    <p class="caption">Mixture of vertical and horizontal elements</p>
  </div>

  <p>Vertical text layouts also need to handle bidirectional text layout;
    clockwise-rotated Arabic, for example, is laid out bottom-to-top.

Block Flow Direction: the 'writing-mode' property</h3>

  <table class="propdef">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Name:</th>
        <td><dfn>writing-mode</dfn></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Value:</th>
        <td>horizontal-tb | vertical-rl | vertical-lr</td>
      </tr>

        <th>Applies to:</th>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
        <td>specified value</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>This property sets the block flow direction. Possible values:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>horizontal-tb</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Top-to-bottom block flow. The writing mode is horizontal.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>vertical-rl</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Right-to-left block flow. The writing mode is vertical.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>vertical-lr</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Left-to-right block flow. The writing mode is vertical.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The 'writing-mode' property determines the direction of block flow.
    This determines the progression of block-level boxes in a block formatting
    context; the progression of line boxes in a block container that contains
    inlines; and the progression of rows in a table. By virtue of determining
    the stacking direction of line boxes, the 'writing-mode' property also
    determines whether line boxes and thus the writing mode is horizontal or
    vertical.

  <p>When set on the root element, the 'writing-mode' property together
    with the 'direction' property determines the
    <dfn id="principal-writing-mode">principal writing mode</dfn>
    of the document. This writing mode is used, for example,
    to determine the default page progression direction. (See [[CSS3PAGE]].)
    The 'writing-mode' value of the root element is also propagated to
    the initial containing block and sets the block flow direction of the
    initial block formatting context.

  <p class="note">Note that the 'writing-mode' property of the HTML BODY
    element is <em>not</em> propagated to the viewport. That special
    behavior only applies to the background and overflow properties.

  <p>If an element has a different block flow direction than its containing
    block:
  <ul>
   <li>If the element has a specified 'display' of ''inline'', its 'display'
     computes to 'inline-block'. [[!CSS21]]
   <li>If the element has a specified 'display' of ''run-in'', its 'display'
     computes to 'block'. [[!CSS21]]
  </ul>
  <p>If such an element is a block container, then it establishes a new
    block formatting context.

  <p>The content of replaced elements do not rotate due to the writing mode:
    images, for example, remain upright. However replaced content
    involving text (such as MathML content or form elements) should match
    the replaced element's writing mode and line orientation if the UA
    supports such a vertical writing mode for the replaced content.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following example, two block elements (1 and 3) separated
      by an image (2) are presented in various flow writing modes.</p>

    <p>Here is a diagram of horizontal writing mode (<code>writing-mode: horizontal-tb</code>):</p>

SVG1.1 'writing-mode' Values</h4>

  <p>SVG1.1 [[!SVG11]] defines some additional values: ''lr'',

  <p>These values are <em>deprecated</em> in any context except SVG1 documents.
    Implementations that wish to support these values in the context of CSS
    must treat them as follows:

  <p class="note">The SVG1.1 values were also present in an older revision
    of the CSS 'writing-mode' specification, which is obsoleted by this
    specification. The additional ''tb-lr'' value of that revision is
    replaced by ''vertical-lr''.

  <p>In SVG1.1, these values set the <dfn>inline progression
    direction</dfn>, in other words, the direction the current text position
    advances each time a glyph is added. This is a geometric process that
    happens <em>after</em> bidi reordering, and thus has no effect on the
    interpretation of the 'direction' property (which is independent of
    'writing-mode'). (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#RelationshipWithBiDirectionality">Relationship
    with bidirectionality</a>. [[!SVG11]])
  <p class="note">There are varying interpretations
    on whether this process causes "writing-mode: rl" to merely shift the
    text string or reverse the order of all glyphs in the text.</p>

<h2 id="inline-alignment">
Inline-level Alignment</h2>

  <p>When different kinds of inline-level content are placed together on a
    line, the baselines of the content and the settings of the 'vertical-align'
    property control how they are aligned in the transverse direction of the
    line box. This section discusses what baselines are, how to find them,
    and how they are used together with the 'vertical-align' property to
    determine the alignment of inline-level content.

<h3 id="intro-baselines">
Introduction to Baselines</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>A <dfn>baseline</dfn> is a line along the <i>inline axis</i> of a line box
    along which individual glyphs of text are aligned. Baselines guide the
    design of glyphs in a font (for example, the bottom of most alphabetic
    glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline), and they guide
    the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting.

  <div class="figure">
    [Picture of alphabetic text in two font sizes with the baseline and
     emboxes indicated.]
  </div>
  
  <p>Different writing systems prefer different baseline tables.</p>

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img alt="Latin prefers the alphabetic baseline, on top of which most
                 letters rest, though some have descenders that dangle below it.
                 Indic scripts are sometimes typeset with a hanging baseline,
                 since their glyph shapes appear to be hanging from a
                 horizontal line.
                 Han-based systems, whose glyphs are designed to fill a square,
                 tend to align on their bottoms."
            src="script-preferred-baselines.gif"></p>
    <p class="caption">Preferred baselines in various writing systems</p>
  </div>

  <p>A well-constructed font contains a <dfn>baseline table</dfn>, which
    indicates the position of one or more baselines within the font's
    design coordinate space. (The design coordinate space is scaled with
    the font size.)

  <div class="figure">
    <p><img alt=""
            src="baselines.gif"></p>
    <p class="caption">In a well-designed mixed-script font, the glyphs are
    positioned in the coordinate space to harmonize with one another
    when typeset together. The baseline table is then constructed to
    match the shape of the glyphs, each baseline positioned to match
    the glyphs from its preferred scripts.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The baseline table is a property of the font, and the positions
    of the various baselines apply to all glyphs in the font.

  <p>Different baseline tables can be provided for alignment in
    horizontal and vertical text. UAs should use the vertical
    tables in vertical typesetting modes and the horizontal tables
    otherwise.

<h3 id="text-baselines">
Text Baselines</h3>

  <p>In this specification, only the following baselines are considered:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>alphabetic</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>alphabetic baseline</dfn>, which typically aligns with the
      bottom of uppercase Latin glyphs. In horizontal typographic mode,
      this is the dominant baseline.

    </dd>
    <dt>central</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>central baseline</dfn>, which typically crosses the center
      of the em box. In vertical typographic mode, this is the
      dominant baseline. If the font is missing this baseline,
      it is assumed to be halfway between the ascender (<i>over</i>)
      and descender (<i>under</i>) edges of the em box.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">A future CSS module will deal with baselines in more
    detail and allow the choice of other dominant baselines and alignment
    options.</p>

<h3 id="replaced-baselines">
Atomic Inline Baselines</h3>

  <p>If an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#inline-boxes">atomic
    inline</a> (such as an inline-block, inline-table, or replaced inline element)
    is not capable of providing its own baseline information, then the
    UA synthesizes a baseline table thus:

  <dl>
    <dt>alphabetic</dt>
    <dd>The alphabetic baseline is assumed to be at the <i>under</i>
      margin edge.</dd>
    <dt>central</dt>
    <dd>The central baseline is assumed to be halfway between the
    <i>under</i> and <i>over</i> margin edges of the box.
  </dl>

<h3 id="baseline-alignment">
Baseline Alignment</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>dominant baseline</dfn>
    (which <a href="#text-baselines">can change</a> based on the writing mode)
    is used in CSS for alignment in two cases:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aligning glyphs from different fonts within the same inline box.</strong>
      The glyphs are aligned by matching up the positions of the dominant
      baseline in their corresponding fonts.
    <li><strong>Aligning a child inline-level box within its parent.</strong>
      For the 'vertical-align' value of ''baseline'', child is aligned to
      the parent by matching the parent's dominant baseline to the same
      baseline in the child. (E.g. if the parent's dominant baseline is
      alphabetic, then the child's alphabetic baseline is matched to the
      parent's alphabetic baseline, even if the child's dominant baseline
      is something else.)
      For values of ''sub'', ''super'', ''&lt;length&gt;'', and
      ''&lt;percentage&gt;'', the baselines are aligned as for ''baseline'',
      but the child is shifted according to the offset given by its
      'vertical-align' value.
      <div class="example">
        <p>Given following sample markup:
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="outer"&gt;Ap &lt;span class="inner"&gt;<i>ji</i>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>And the following style rule:
        <pre>span.inner { font-size: .75em; }</pre>
        <p>The baseline tables of the parent (<code>.outer</code>) and the child
          (<code>.inner</code>) will not match up due to the font size difference.
          Since the dominant baseline is the alphabetic baseline, the child box
          is aligned to its parent by matching up their alphabetic baselines.
        <div class="figure">
          <p><img alt="" src="baseline-align-sizes.gif">
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="example">
      <p>If we assign ''vertical-align: super'' to the <code>.inner</code>
        element from the example above, the same rules are used to align
        the <code>.inner</code> child to its parent; the only difference
        is in addition to the baseline alignment, the child is shifted to
        the superscript position.
      <pre>span.inner { vertical-align: super; font-size: .75em; }</pre>
      <div class="figure">
        <p><img alt="In this example, the resulting alignment is equivalent

                     alphabetic baseline to the shifted position of the
                     parent's alphabetic baseline."

  <p>In modern typographic systems, all glyphs are assigned a horizontal
    orientation, which is used when laying out text horizontally.
    To lay out vertical text, the UA needs to transform the text from its
    horizontal orientation. This transformation is the <dfn>bi-orientational
    transform</dfn>, and there are two types:

  <dl>
    <dt>rotate</dt>
      <dd>Rotate the glyph from horizontal to vertical
      <a href="diagrams/glyph-right.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
        <img src="diagrams/glyph-right.png" class="figure"
          alt="Rotate the glyph from horizontal to vertical"></a>
        
    <dt>translate</dt>
      <dd>Translate the glyph from horizontal to vertical
      <a href="diagrams/glyph-upright.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
        <img src="diagrams/glyph-upright.png" class="figure"
          alt="Translate the glyph from horizontal to vertical"></a>
  </dl>

  <p>Scripts with a native vertical orientation have an
    intrinsic bi-orientational transform, which orients them correctly in
    vertical text: CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters translate,
    that is, they are always upright. Other scripts, such as Mongolian,
    rotate. (See <a href="#script-orientations">Appendix B</a> for a list of
    intrinsic bi-orientational transforms.)</p>

  <p>Scripts without a native vertical orientation can be either rotated
    (set sideways) or translated (set upright): the transform used is a
    stylistic preference depending on the text's usage, rather than a
    matter of correctness.
    The 'text-orientation' property's ''upright-right'' and ''upright'' values
    are provided to specify rotation vs. translation of horizontal-only text.

  <p class="note">The ''sideways-left'', ''sideways-right'', and ''sideways''
    values of 'text-orientation' are provided for decorative layout effects
    and to work around limitations in CSS support for bottom-to-top scripts.

  <p class="issue">Ideally, punctuation should be either sideways or upright
    depending on whether the primary script is horizontal-only or vertical.
    However, this information (which, like the base directionality,
    is a property of the content) is not available to us. (UTN 22 used the
    concept of a vertical directionality, given via 'direction' or the HTML
    <code>dir</code> attribute to handle this issue.) The current spec works
    around this by using the East Asian Width property; but this approach only
    works if vertical scripts do not share punctuation with horizontal-only
    scripts.

  <p>This property specifies the orientation of characters within a line
    and sets the orientation of the line. Current values only
    have an effect in vertical writing modes.

  <p>For readability, the term <i>character</i> is used in place of
    <em>extended grapheme cluster</em> in this section.
    See <a href="#character-properties">Characters and Properties</a>
    for further details.

  <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>upright-right</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, characters from horizontal-only
      scripts are set sideways, i.e. 90&deg; clockwise from their standard
      orientation in horizontal text.
      Characters from vertical scripts are set with their intrinsic orientation.
    <p>In vertical writing modes, this value puts the element in a <i>vertical
      typographic mode</i> and is typical for layout of primarily
      vertical-script text.
    <dt><dfn>upright</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, characters from horizonal-only
      scripts are rendered upright, i.e. in their standard horizontal
      orientation.
      Shaping characters from such scripts are shaped in their isolated forms.
      Characters from vertical scripts are set with their intrinsic orientation
      and shaped normally.
      When available, vertical glyph variants and vertical font metrics
      are used to set the text. The UA must synthesize vertical font
      metrics for grapheme clusters that do not have any.
      <p>For the purposes of bidi reordering, this value causes all
      characters to be treated as strong LTR.
      This value causes the used value of 'direction' to be ''ltr''.
      <p>In vertical writing modes, this value puts the element in a <i>vertical
      typographic mode</i>.
    <dt><dfn>sideways-right</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, this causes text to be set as if
      in a horizontal layout (using horizontal glyph variants and metrics),
      but rotated 90&deg; clockwise.
      This value puts the element in a <i>horizontal typographic mode</i>.
    <dt><dfn>sideways-left</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>In vertical writing modes, this causes text to be set as if
      in a horizontal layout (using horizontal glyph variants and metrics),
      but rotated 90&deg; counter-clockwise.
      This value puts the element in a <i>horizontal typographic mode</i>.
      <p>If set on a non-replaced inline whose parent is not ''sideways-left'',
      this forces bidi isolation: the ''normal'' and ''embed'' values of
      'unicode-bidi' compute to ''isolate'', and ''bidi-override'' computes
      to ''bidi-override isolate''.
      Layout of text is exactly as for ''sideways-right'' except that the
      text content and baseline table of each of the element's inline boxes
      is mirrored around a vertical axis along the center of its content box.
      The positions of text decorations propagated from an ancestor inline
      (including the block container's root inline) are not mirrored, but any
      text decorations introduced by the element are positioned using the
      mirrored baseline table.
      <p>Similarly, if an inline child of the element has a 'text-orientation'
      value other than ''sideways-left'', an analogous transformation (and
      bidi isolation) is applied.
    <dt><dfn>sideways</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>This value is equivalent to ''sideways-right'' in ''vertical-rl''
      writing mode and equivalent to ''sideways-left'' in ''vertical-lr''
      writing mode. It can be useful when setting horizontal script text
      vertically in a primarily horizontal-only document.
    <dt><dfn>use-glyph-orientation</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>[[!SVG11]] defines 'glyph-orientation-vertical' and
      'glyph-orientation-horizontal' properties that were intended to control
      text orientation. These properties are <em>deprecated</em> and do not
      apply to non-SVG elements. If an implementation supports these properties,
      the ''use-glyph-orientation'' value when set on SVG elements indicates
      that the SVG
      'glyph-orientation-vertical' and 'glyph-orientation-horizontal'
      behavior control the layout of text. Such UAs must set
      ''text-orientation: glyph-orientation'' on all
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#TermTextContentElement">SVG
      text content elements</a> in their default UA style sheet for SVG.
      <p>In all other contexts, and for implementations that do not support
      the glyph orientation properties, the ''use-glyph-orientation'' behavior
      is the same as for ''upright-right''.
      <p class="note">This value is at-risk and may be dropped during CR.

Abstract Box Terminology</h2>

  <p>[[!CSS21]] defines the box layout model of CSS in detail. However,
    it only defines the box model for the ''horizontal-tb'' writing mode.
    CSS box layout in writing modes other than ''horizontal-tb'' is
    analogous to the box layout defined in CSS2.1 if directions and
    dimensions are abstracted and remapped appropriately. This section
    defines abstract directional and dimensional terms and their mappings
    in order to define box layout for other writing modes, and to provide
    terminology for future specs to define their layout concepts abstractly.

<h3 id="abstract-dimensions">
Logical Dimensions</h3>

    <dt><dfn>block flow dimension</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The dimension perpendicular to the flow of text with in a line,

      <dd>The dimension parallel to the flow of text within a line, i.e.

      <dd>A measurement in the block flow dimension: refers to the

      <dd>A measurement in the inline dimension: refers to the
        physical width (horizontal dimension) in horizontal writing
        modes, and to the physical height (vertical dimension) in
        vertical writing modes. (The term <i>measure</i> derives
        from its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_%28typography%29">use
        in typography</a>.)</dd>
  </dl>

<h3 id="abstract-directions">
Abstract and Physical Directions</h3>

  <p>The terms <dfn>left</dfn>, <dfn>right</dfn>, <dfn>top</dfn>, and <dfn>bottom</dfn>
    are always interpreted physically, i.e. with respect to the page
    independent of writing mode. Two abstract mappings are
    possible for these directions: line-relative and flow-relative,
    which are defined below.

  <p>Although they derive from the behavior of text, these directional
    terms exist even for boxes that do not contain any line boxes:
    they are calculated directly from the values of the 'writing-mode',
    'text-orientation', and 'direction' properties.

<h3 id="line-directions">
Line-relative Directions</h3>

  <p>Although the block flow direction given by 'writing-mode' determines
    whether the line is oriented horizontally or vertically, it doesn't
    say anything about how the contents within the line are arranged.

  <p>The <dfn>line-relative directions</dfn> are <i>over</i>, <i>under</i>,
    <i>line-left</i>, and <i>line-right</i>.
    The <dfn>line orientation</dfn>, which is given by a combination of
    'text-orientation' and 'writing-mode', determines which side of the line is
    the "top" and thus which sides are <dfn>under</dfn> (ascender side) and
    <dfn>over</dfn> (descender side) the line. The line orientation also
    affects the interpretation of alignment ('vertical-align') in the
    transverse dimension of the line.

  <p>In addition to its <i>over</i> and <i>under</i> sides, a line box, even
    a vertically-oriented one, also has a "left" and "right" side, which we
    will call the <i>line-left</i> and <i>line-right</i> sides of the box (as
    distinct from the physical left and physical right sides of the box).
    The <dfn>line-left</dfn> edge of a box is nominally the edge from which 
    <abbr title="left-to-right">LTR</abbr> text would start. The
    <dfn>line-right</dfn> edge of a box is nominally the edge from which
    <abbr title="right-to-left">RTL</abbr> text would start. Depending on the
    'writing-mode' and 'text-orientation' properties, the line-left side of
    a box could be on the physical left, top, or bottom.

  <p class="note">Note also that while the <i>over</i> and <i>under</i>
    directions often map to the same directions as <a href="#before">before</a>
    and <a href="#after">after</a> respectively, this mapping is reversed
    for some combinations of 'writing-mode' and 'text-orientation'.

<h3 id="logical-directions">
Flow-relative Directions</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>flow-relative directions</dfn> are
    <a href="#before">before</a>,
    <a href="#after">after</a>,
    <a href="#start">start</a>, and
    <a href="#end">end</a>. In an <abbr title="left-to-right">LTR</abbr>
    ''horizontal-tb'' writing mode, they correspond to the
    top, bottom, left, and right directions, respectively.
    
  <p>The <dfn>before</dfn> edge of a box is nominally the edge that comes
    earlier in the block progression, as determined by the 'writing-mode'
    property. Similarly the <dfn>after</dfn> edge is the edge that comes later
    in the progression.

  <p>The <dfn>start</dfn> edge of a box is nominally the edge from which
    text of its inline base direction will start. For boxes with
    a used 'direction' value of ''ltr'', this means the <i>line-left</i>
    edge. For boxes with a used 'direction' value of ''rtl'', this means
    the <i>line-right</i> edge. The edge opposite the start edge is the
    <dfn>end</dfn> edge.

  <p class="note">Note that while determining the <i>before</i> and
    <i>after</i> edges of a box depends only on the 'writing-mode' property,
    determining the <i>start</i> and <i>end</i> edges of a box depends not
    only on the 'writing-mode' property but also the 'direction' <em>and</em>
    'text-orientation' properties.</p>

Abstract Box Layout</h2>

<h3 id="vertical-layout">
Principles of Layout in Vertical Writing Modes</h3>

  <p>CSS box layout in vertical writing modes is analogous to layout in
    the horizontal writing modes, following the principles outlined below:

  <p>Layout calculation rules (such as those in CSS2.1, Section 10.3)
     that apply to the horizontal dimension in horizontal writing modes
     instead apply to the vertical dimension in vertical writing modes.
     Likewise, layout calculation rules (such as those in CSS2.1, Section 10.6)
     that apply to the vertical dimension in horizontal writing modes
     instead apply to the horizontal dimension in vertical writing modes.
     Thus:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Layout rules that refer to the width use the height instead,
        and vice versa.
    <li><p>Layout rules that refer to the '*-left' and '*-right' box
        properties (border, margin, padding) use '*-top' and '*-bottom'
        instead, and vice versa. Which side of the
        box the property applies to doesn't change: only which values
        are inputs to which layout calculations changes. The 'margin-left'
        property still affects the lefthand margin, for example; however
        in a ''vertical-rl'' writing mode it takes part in margin collapsing
        in place of 'margin-bottom'.</p>
    <li><p>Layout rules that depend on the 'direction' property to choose between
        left and right (e.g. overflow, overconstraint resolution, the initial
        value for 'text-align', table column ordering)
        are abstracted to the <a href="#start">start</a> and
        <a href="#end">end</a> sides and applied appropriately.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <p>For example, in vertical writing modes, table rows are vertical and
      table columns are horizontal. In a ''vertical-rl'' ''upright-right''
      ''rtl'' table, the first column would be on the bottom (the start side),
      and the first row on the right (the before side). The table's 'margin-right'
      and 'margin-left' would collapse with margins before (on the right) and
      after (on the left) the table, respectively, and if the table had ''auto''
      values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' it would be centered
      vertically within its block flow.
    <div class="figure">
      <p><a href="diagrams/vertical-table.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
        <img alt="Diagram of a vertical-rl upright-right rtl table in a
        vertical block formatting context, showing the ordering of rows,
        cells, and columns as described above."
              class="example" src="diagrams/vertical-table.png"></a>
      <p class="caption">Table in ''vertical-rl'' RTL writing mode</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <p>For features such as text alignment, floating, and list marker positioning,
    that primarily reference the left or right sides of the line box or
    its longitudinal parallels and therefore have no top or bottom equivalent,
    the <a href="#line-left">line left</a> and <a href="#line-right">line
    right</a> sides are used as the reference for the left and right sides
    respectively.

  <p>Likewise for features such as underlining, overlining, and baseline alignment
    (the unfortunately-named 'vertical-align'), that primarily reference the
    top or bottom sides of the linebox or its transversal parallels and
    therefore have no left or right equivalent, the <a href="#over">over</a>
    and <a href="#under">under</a> sides are used as the reference for the
    top and bottom sides respectively.

  <p>The details of these mappings are provided below.

<h3 id="dimension-mapping">
Dimensional Mapping</h3>

<!--
  <p>Properties that are named in terms of the x and y axes are
    logical with respect to the block flow direction rather than absolute
    with respect to the page. Specifically:

  <ul>
    <li>The ''repeat-x'' keyword of 'background-repeat' tiles in the
      inline dimension of the element, which is not necessarily the
      horizontal dimension. [[!CSS21]] [[!CSS3BG]]
    <li>The ''repeat-y'' keyword of 'background-repeat' tiles in the
      block flow dimension of the element, which is not necessarily
      the vertical dimension. [[!CSS21]] [[!CSS3BG]]
    <li>The 'overflow-x' property controls overflow in the inline
      dimension of the element. [[!CSS3UI]]
    <li>The 'overflow-y' property controls overflow in the block
      flow dimension of the element. [[!CSS3UI]]
  </ul>
-->

  <p>Certain properties behave logically as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>The first and second values of the 'border-spacing' property
      represent spacing between columns and rows respectively, not
      necessarily the horizontal and vertical spacing respectively.
      [[!CSS21]]
    <li>The 'line-height' property always refers to the logical
      height. [[!CSS21]]
  </ul>

  <p>The height properties ('height', 'min-height', and 'max-height')
    refer to the physical height, and the width properties ('width',
    'min-width', and 'max-width') refer to the physical width. However,
    the rules used to calculate box dimensions and positions are logical.

  <p>For example, the calculation rules in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins">CSS2.1 Section 10.3</a>
    are used for the inline dimension measurements: they apply to the
    measure (which could be either the physical width or physical
    height) and to the the start and end margins, padding, and border.
    Likewise the calculation rules in
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins">CSS2.1 Section 10.6</a>
    are used in the block dimension: they apply to the extent and to
    the before and after margins, padding, and border. [[!CSS21]]

  <p>As a corollary, percentages on the margin and padding properties,
    which are always calculated with respect to the containing block
    width in CSS2.1, are calculated with respect to the <em>measure</em>
    of the containing block in CSS3.

<h3 id="orthogonal-flows">
Orthogonal Flows</h3>

  <p>When an element has a different 'writing-mode' from its
    containing block two cases are possible:
  <ul>
    <li>The two writing modes are parallel to each other. (For example,
      ''vertical-rl'' and ''vertical-lr'').</li>
    <li>The two writing modes are perpendicular to each other. (For
      example, ''horizontal-tb'' and ''vertical-rl'').</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To handle the second case, CSS layout calculations are divided into
    two phases: sizing a box, and positioning the box within its flow.
    In the sizing phase&#8212;calculating the width and height of the
    box&#8212;the dimensions of the box and the containing block
    are mapped to the measure and extent and calculations performed
    accordingly using the writing mode of the element.
    In the positioning phase&#8212;calculating the positioning offsets,
    margins, borders, and padding&#8212;the dimensions of the box and
    its containing block are mapped to the measure and extent and
    calculations performed according to the writing mode of the
    containing block.

  <p>For example, if a vertical block is placed inside a horizontal
    block, then when calculating the physical height (which is the
    measure) of the child block the physical height of the parent
    block is used to calculate the measure of the child's containing
    block, even though the physical height is the extent, not the
    measure, of the parent block.</p>

  <p>Since auto margins are resolved consistent with the containing
    block's writing mode, a box establishing an orthogonal flow, can,
    once sized, be aligned or centered within its containing block just
    like other block-level elements by using auto margins.

  <p>It is common in CSS for a containing block to have a defined
    measure, but not a defined extent. This typically happens in
    CSS2.1 when a containing block has an ''auto'' height, for
    example: its width is given by the calculations in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#blockwidth">10.3.3</a>,
    but its extent depends on its contents. In such cases the
    <dfn>available measure</dfn> is defined as the measure of the
    containing block; but the <dfn>available extent</dfn>, which
    would otherwise be the extent of the containing block, is
    infinite.
    
  <p>Orthogonal flows allow the opposite to happen: for the
    <i>available extent</i> to be defined, but the <i>available
    measure</i> to be infinite. In such cases a percentage of the
    containing block measure cannot be defined, and thus the
    initial containing block's size is used instead as a
    <i>fallback measure</i> to calculate such percentages.

<h4 id="orthogonal-auto">
Auto-sizing in Orthogonal Flows</h4>

  <p>If the computed measure of an element establishing an orthogonal
    flow is ''auto'', then the used measure is calculated as the
    <i>fit-content</i> (shrink-to-fit) size using the initial containing
    block's size as the available measure.

<h4 id="orthogonal-multicol">
Multi-column Layout in Orthogonal Flows</h4>

  <p>If the UA supports CSS Multi-column Layout [[!CSS3COL]], then
    for the case where the element's extent or available extent is
    defined but the element's measure is ''auto'':

  <ol>
    <li>If 'column-count' and 'column-width' are both ''auto'', a
      used 'column-width' is calculated for the element as the
      <i>fill-available measure</i> using the <i>fallback measure</i>
      as the <i>available measure</i>.
    <li>If the columns' extent is not fixed, the <i>fill-available
      extent</i> of the element is used.
    <li>The used column-count then follows from filling the resulting
      columns with the element's content.
  </ol>

  <p>The used measure of the resulting multi-column element is then
    calculated:
    if the content neither wraps nor paginates within the multi-column
    element, then the used measure is the <i>max-content measure</i>
    of the element's contents;
    else it is calculated from the used column width, column count,
    and column gap.
  <p>The used extent of the element is either the used column extent
    (if multiple columns were used) or the <i>max-content extent</i>
    of the content.

  <p class="note">This should behave the same as the auto-sizing algorithm
    defined in the previous section, except overflowing content, instead of
    continuing off the side of the containing block, is wrapped into
    columns in the flow direction of the containing block, thus avoiding
    T-shaped documents.</p>

<h4 id="orthogonal-pagination">
Paginating Orthogonal Flows</h4>

  <p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

  <p>With regards to pagination, the rules in CSS2.1 still hold in
    vertical writing modes and orthogonal flows: page break opportunities
    do not occur inside line boxes, only between them.
    UAs that support [[!CSS3COL]] may break in the (potentially zero-width)
    gap between columns, however.

  <p>Note that if content spills outside the pagination stream
    established by the root element, the UA is not required to print
    such content. Authors wishing to mix writing modes with long streams
    of text are thus encouraged to use CSS columns to keep all content 
    flowing in the document's pagination direction.

  <div class="note">
    <p>In other words, if your document would require two scrollbars on
    the screen it probably won't all print. Fix your layout, e.g. by
    using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">columns</a> so
    that it all scrolls (and therefore paginates) in one direction if
    you want to make sure it'll all print. T-shaped documents tend not
    to print well.
  </div>

<h3 id="logical-direction-layout">
Flow-Relative Mappings</h3>

  <p>Flow-relative directions are calculated with respect to
    the writing mode of the <em>containing block</em> of the
    element and used to abstract layout rules related to the
    box properties (margins, borders, padding) and any properties
    related to positioning the box within its containing block
    ('float', 'clear', 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right')
    For inline-level elements, the writing mode of the <em>parent
    element</em> is used instead.

  <p>For example, the margin that is dropped when a box's inline
    dimension is
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#blockwidth">over-constrained</a>
    is the end margin as determined by the writing mode of the
    containing block.

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#collapsing-margins">margin
    collapsing rules</a> apply exactly with the <em>before
    margin</em> substituted for the top margin and the
    <em>after margin</em> substituted for the bottom margin.
    Similarly the before padding and border are substituted
    for the top padding and border, and the after padding and
    border substituted for the bottom padding and border.
    Note this means only before and after margins ever collapse.

  <p>Flow-relative directions are calculated with respect to
    the writing mode of the element and used to abstract layout
    related to the element's contents:

  <ul>
    <li>The initial value of the 'text-align' property
      aligns to the start edge of the line box.
    <li>The 'text-indent' property indents from the start
      edge of the line box.
    <li>For tables, the ordering of columns begins on the start
      side of the table, and the ordering of rows begins on the
      before side of the table.
  </ul>

<h3 id="line-mappings">
Line-Relative Mappings</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>line-relative directions</dfn> are
    <a href="#over">over</a>,
    <a href="#under">under</a>,
    <a href="#line-left">line-left</a>, and
    <a href="#line-right">line-right</a>. In an
    <abbr title="left-to-right">LTR</abbr>
    ''horizontal-tb'' writing mode, they correspond to the
    top, bottom, left, and right directions, respectively.

  <p>The line-right and line-left directions are calculated
    with respect to the writing mode of the element and used
    to interpret the ''left'' and ''right'' values of the
    following properties:
  <ul>
    <li>the 'text-align' property [[!CSS21]]
  </ul>

  <p>The line-right and line-left directions are calculated
    with respect to the writing mode of the <em>containing
    block</em> of the element and used to interpret the ''left''
    and ''right'' values of the following properties:
  <ul>
    <li>the 'float' property [[!CSS21]]
    <li>the 'clear' property [[!CSS21]]
  </ul>

  <p>The over and under directions are calculated with respect to
    the writing mode of the element and used to define the
    interpretation of the "top" (over edge) and "bottom" (under
    edge) of the line box as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>For the 'vertical-align' property, the "top" of the
      line box is the over edge; the "bottom" of the line box
      is the under edge. Positive length and percentage values
      shift the baseline towards the over edge. [[!CSS21]]
    <li>For the 'text-decoration' property, the underline is
      drawn on the under side of the text; the overline is
      drawn on the over side of the text. [[!CSS21]]
      <span class="note">Note that the CSS Text Module defines
      this in more detail and provides additional controls for
      controlling the position of underlines and overlines.
      [[CSS3TEXT]]</span>
  </ul>

<h3 id="physical-only">
Purely Physical Mappings</h3>

  <p>The following values are purely physical in their definitions
    and do not respond to changes in writing mode:

  <ul>
    <li>the ''rect()'' notation of the 'clip' property [[!CSS21]]
    <li>the background properties [[!CSS21]] [[!CSS3BG]]
    <li>the border-image properties [[!CSS3BG]]
    <li>the offsets of the 'box-shadow' and 'text-shadow' properties
  </ul>

  <p>This module introduces two new values to the 'caption-side' property:
    ''before'' and ''after'', which position the caption before and
    after the table box, respectively. For tables with ''horizontal-tb''
    writing mode, they are equivalent to the existing ''top'' and
    ''bottom'' values, respectively. [[!CSS21]]

  <p class='note'>For implementations that support the 'top-outside'
    and 'bottom-outside' model, corresponding 'before-outside' and
    'after-outside' will be similarly introduced.

  <p>Implementations that support the ''top'' and ''bottom'' values
    of the 'caption-side' property but do not support side captions
    (i.e. ''left'' and ''right'' captions in horizontal writing modes)
    must treat ''top'' and ''bottom'' as ''before'', when the table
    is in a vertical writing mode.

  <p>For implementations that do support side captions (i.e. the ''left''
    and ''right'' values from the obsolete CSS&nbsp;2.0 specification
    [[CSS2]]), this module also introduces the ''start''
    and ''end'' values, which behave similarly and which position the
    caption on the start and end sides of the table box, calculated
    with respect to the writing mode of the table element. For such
    implementations, the ''top'' and ''bottom'' values must place the
    caption on the top and bottom sides of the table box, respectively.

  <p class="note">The CSS2.0 side caption model had some
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2002Dec/0142.html">problems</a>
    and will likely have a different definition in CSS3.</p>

<!--
<h3 id="html-attributes">HTML Attributes</h3>

  <p>This section defines the mapping of HTML presentational attributes
    in CSS. This section is normative for user agents supporting HTML
    in addition to the 'writing-mode' property. [[!HTML40]] [[!HTML5]]

  <h4 id="width-height-attributes">The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes</h4>

  <p>The HTML <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes refer
    to the physical width and height for elements that that are replaced,
    i.e.
    <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>,
    and
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>

  <p>Form elements elements contain text, therefore their contents should be
    affected by writing mode, in which case these attributes refer to the
    <em>logical</em> width and height. The UA may, however, choose not
    to rotate nor flip these elements in vertical writing modes if it is not
    capable, and in that case, these attributes remain physical.</p>
    <p class="issue">when not to rotate form elements/MathML,
      should treat them as images (always upright)
      or to force writing-mode to always calculate to horizontal-tb?</p>

  <p>On table-related elements (<code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;col&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>) the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
    attributes are always logical.

  <p>The <code>size</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element
    is also logical (refers to the logical height).

  <h4 id="alignment-attributes">Alignment, Float and Clear Attributes</h4>

  <p>The following attributes behave the same way as their corresponding
    CSS properties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>align</code> as 'float' or 'text-align'</li>
    <li><code>clear</code> as 'clear'</li>
    <li><code>valign</code> as 'vertical-align'</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="spacing-attributes">Spacing Attributes</h4>

  <p>The following attributes are logical and, as margins, are logical
    with respect to the writing mode of the <em>parent</em> element.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>hspace</code> as start and end margins</li>
    <li><code>vspace</code> as before and after margins</li>
    <li>marginwidth</li>
    <li>marginheight</li>
  </ul>
-->

<h2 id="page-direction">
Page Flow: the page progression direction</h2>

  <p>In paged media CSS2.1 classifies all pages as either left or right pages.
    The page progression direction, which determines whether the left or right
    page in a spread is first in the flow and whether the first page is by
    default a left or right page, depends on the writing direction as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>The page progression is right-to-left if the root element's
      'writing-mode' is ''vertical-rl'' or if the root element's 'writing-mode'
      is ''horizontal-tb'' and its 'direction' is ''rtl''.
    <li>The page progression is left-to-right if the root element's
      'writing-mode' is ''vertical-lr'' or if the root element's 'writing-mode'
      is ''horizontal-tb'' and its 'direction' is ''ltr''.
  </ul>

  <p>(Unless otherwise overridden, the first page of a document begins on the
    second half of a spread, e.g. on the right page in a left-to-right page
    progression.)

  <p>This property allows the combination of multiple characters into the

      of the element horizontally within the vertical line box, ideally
      within the space of one ideographic character. (See below.) The
      resulting composition is treated as a single glyph for the purposes
      of layout and decoration.
      If the content contains any element boundaries, or if it contains
      more characters than the integer given (if any), this is treated as

      digit number would use halfwidth or proportional glyphs, a three-digit
      number would use 1/3-em glyphs (if available, else halfwidth or
      proportional glyphs), etc.
      If such glyphs are not available (and ''no-scale'' is not specified),

      cause the glyphs to overflow the line significantly.
  </dl>

  <p class="issue">All values except ''all'' are marked at-risk. Which
    ones should we take to CR?</p>

  <p>When combining text as for ''text-combine-horizontal: all'', the
    glyphs of the combined text are stacked horizontally (without line
    breaks, letter-spacing, etc., but using the specified font settings),
    similar to the contents of an inline-box with a horizontal writing
    mode and a line-height of 1em. The effective size of the composition
    is assumed to be 1em square; anything outside the square is not
    measured for layout purposes. The UA should center the glyphs
    horizontally and vertically within the measured 1em square.
    The baseline of the resulting composition chosen such that the
    square is centered between the text-over and text-under baselines
    of its parent inline box prior to any baseline alignment shift.
    For text layout purposes,
    e.g. bidi ordering, line-breaking, emphasis marks, text-decoration,
    etc. the resulting composition is treated as a single glyph
    representing the Object Replacement Character U+FFFC.

  <p>If none of ''scale'', ''no-scale'', or ''use-glyphs'' are specified
    and the contents are wider than the width tolerance, the UA must
    compress the contents to within the tolerance, but may use any
    method to do so.

  <p>In some fonts, the ideographic glyphs are given a compressed design
    such that they are 1em wide but shorter than 1em tall. To accommodate
    such fonts, the UA may vertically scale the contents of the composition
    to match the advance height of 水 U+6C34.
  <!-- 水 U+6C34 was chosen because it is a very basic character common to
    all Han-based scripts, so would have to appear in any usable ideographic
    font; and its shape is very full in both dimensions, so it would be
    unlikely to be shortened in a proportional font -->

  <p>Any CSS fullwidth transformations
    (''text-transform: full-width'' [[CSS3TEXT]] or
    ''font-variant-east-asian-width: full-width'' [[CSS3FONT]])
    are turned off for combined text of more than one character.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In East Asian documents, the ''text-combine-horizontal'' effect is often
      used to display Latin-based strings such as components of a date or
      letters of an initialism, always in a horizontal writing mode
      regardless of the writing mode of the line:</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p><img alt="Diagram of tate-chu-yoko, showing the two digits of a date
                   set halfwidth side-by-side in a vertical column of text"

      <p class="caption">Example of horizontal-in-vertical <i lang="ja">tate-chu-yoko</i></p>

    <p>The figure is the result of the rules</p>
    <pre>
<!-- -->date { text-combine-horizontal: digits 2; }

    <p>and the following markup:</p>

    <p>In Japanese, this effect is known as <i lang="ja">tate-chu-yoko</i>.

  <div class="example">
    <p>The following example shows that applying ''text-combine-horizontal: digits''

<h2 id="character-properties" class="no-num">Appendix Q.
Characters and Properties</h2>

  <p>Unicode defines three character-level properties that are referenced
    in CSS Writing Modes:
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/#Definitions">East Asian width</a>
    <dd>Defined in [[!UAX11]] and given as the East_Asian_Width property
      in the Unicode Character Database [[!UAX44]].
    <dt><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values">General Category</a>
    <dd>Defined in [[!UAX44]] and given as the General_Category property
      in the Unicode Character Database [[!UAX44]].
    <dt><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Values">Script property</a>
    <dd>Defined in [[!UAX24]] and given as the Script property
      in the Unicode Character Database [[!UAX44]]. (UAs should
      include any ScriptExtensions.txt assignments in this mapping.)
  </dl>

  <p id=grapheme-cluster>In several sections (as noted), the term
    <dfn>character</dfn> is defined as <em>extended grapheme cluster</em>
    per [[!UAX29]]. It is roughly equivalent to what a language user
    considers to be a character or a basic unit of the script (which
    might not be a single Unicode codepoint).
    The UA may further tailor this definition as allowed by Unicode.

  <p>Unicode defines properties for characters, but for 'text-orientation' and
    <a href="vertical-typesetting-details">Vertical Typesetting Synthesis</a>,
    it is necessary to determine the properties of a grapheme cluster.
    For the purposes of CSS Writing Modes, the properties of a grapheme
    cluster are given by its base character&#8212;except in two cases:
  <ul>
    <li>Grapheme clusters formed with an Enclosing Mark (Me) of the Common
    script are considered to be Other Symbols (So) in the Common script.
    They are assumed to have the same Unicode properties as the
    Replacement Character U+FFFD.
    <li>Grapheme clusters formed with a Space Separator (Zs) as the base
    are considered to be Modifier Symbols (Sk). They are assumed to have
    the same East Asian Width property as the base, but take their other
    properties from the first combining character in the sequence.
  </ul>

<h2 class="no-num" id="script-orientations">Appendix B:
Bi-orientational Transformations</h2>
  <p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>

  <p>This appendix gives the orientational properties of scripts in Unicode 6.0
    [[!UNICODE]]. Any script not listed explicitly is assumed to be
    <i>horizontal-only</i>. The script classification of Unicode characters is
    given by [[!UAX24]].

  <table class="data">
    <caption>Vertical Scripts and their Bi-orientational Transform</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Code	<th>Name                	<th>Transform
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Bopo	<td>Bopomofo            	<td>translate
      <tr><td>Egyp	<td>Egyptian Hieroglyphs	<td>translate
      <tr><td>Hira	<td>Hiragana            	<td>translate
      <tr><td>Kana	<td>Katakana            	<td>translate
      <tr><td>Hani	<td>Han                 	<td>translate
      <tr><td>Hang	<td>Hangul              	<td>translate

      <tr><td>Yiii	<td>Yi                  	<td>translate
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong>
    For the purposes of this specification, all fullwidth (F) and wide (W) characters
    are treated as belonging to a vertical script with a translate
    bi-orientational transform.
    All halfwidth (H) characters are treated as belonging to
    a vertical script with a rotate bi-orientational transform.
    [[!UAX11]]
    Neutral (N), narrow (Na) and ambiguous (A) Letters (L*) belonging
    to the Common script are treated as belonging to a horizontal-only script.

  <p class="note">Ogham is also a rotating bi-orientational script, but
    because it is a bottom-to-top script, for the purposes of this
    specification it is treated as left-to-right horizontal. A future
    version of CSS may define proper handling of bottom-to-top scripts.
    Authors can work around this lack of support with the ''sideways-left''
    value of 'text-orientation'.

<h2 id="vertical-typesetting-details" class="no-num">Appendix C:
Vertical Typesetting Synthesis</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This section defines an algorithm for automatic typesetting of
    vertical text.

    For readability, the term <i>character</i> is used in place of
    <em>extended grapheme cluster</em> in this section.
    See <a href="#character-properties">Characters and Properties</a>
    for further details.

  <p class="issue">This section needs careful review.</p>

  <p>When 'text-orientation' is either ''upright-right'' or ''upright'',
    the following settings are recommended:

  <ol>
    <li>Set any spaces (Zs), connectors (Pc), and
      bracketing punctuation (Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf)
      either upright using vertical font settings if available
      or sideways if they are not.
      <p class="note">Thus a THREE-PER-EM SPACE (U+2004) can be expected
      to provide a 1/3-em advance in the inline dimension, and brackets
      can be expected to encase their contents.</p>
    <li>Set East Asian fullwidth (F) and wide (W) characters upright
      (using vertical font settings if available).
    <li>Set any dashes (Pd) either upright using vertical font settings if
      available or sideways if they are not. <!-- fullwidth hyphen-minus need to be upright -->
    <li>Set East Asian halfwidth (H) characters sideways (or upright with
      vertical font settings if possible).
    <li>Set any other characters that are assigned to a script
      (i.e. do not belong to the Common, Inherited, or Unknown scripts)
      as required by 'text-orientation' and <a href="#script-orientations">Appendix B</a>.
  </ol>

  <p>When 'text-orientation' is ''upright-right'', the following settings
    are recommended for characters not otherwise-specified above:
  <ol>
    <li>Set the following characters using vertical font settings if
      available, otherwise set them sideways:
      <ul>
        <li>Other Punctuation (Po) with an East Asian Width width
          of ambiguous (A).

        <li>All Other Symbols (So) characters not otherwise specified above.
        <li>All Other Numbers (No) characters not otherwise specified above.
      </ul>
    <li>Set all other characters sideways (i.e. rotated,
      using horizontal font settings).
  </ol>

  <p>When 'text-orientation' is ''upright-right'', set all characters
    upright (using vertical font settings if available) unless

Intrinsic Dimensions</h2>

  <p><em>This section is normative.</em></p>
  
  <p>CSS layout has several different concepts of automatic sizing that
    are used in various layout calculations. This section defines some
    more precise terminology to help connect the layout behaviors of this
    spec to the calculations used in other modules, and some new keywords
    for the width and height properties to allow authors to assign elements
    the dimensions resulting from these size calculations.

      (In the case of orthogonal flows, this is the measure of the initial
      containing block.)
      The <dfn>fill-available extent</dfn> is similarly calculated by
      using the corresponding values from the block dimension.
    <dt><dfn>fit-content</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Called the <i>shrink-to-fit</i> width in
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#float-width">CSS2.1&sect;10.3.5</a>,
      and
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#pseudo-algorithm">CSS3 Multi-column Layout &sect; 3.4</a>,
      the <dfn>fit-content measure</dfn> is defined as
      <code>max(<i>min-content</i>, min(<i>max-content</i>, <i>fill-available</i>))</code>
      if the available measure is finite, and as the <i>max-content</i>
      measure otherwise. The <dfn>fit-content extent</dfn> is calculated
      from the same expression applied to the block dimension.
  </dl>

  <p>For the layout models in CSS2.1, both the <dfn>min-content extent</dfn>
    and <dfn>max-content extent</dfn> of non-replaced elements are defined
    as the content extent as defined (for horizontal writing modes) in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#normal-block">CSS2.1&sect;10.6.3</a>
    and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#height-layout">CSS2.1&sect;17.5.3</a>
    for elements with ''height: auto''.

  <p>For replaced elements, the <i>min-content</i> and <i>max-content</i>
    sizes are the same and correspond used size of the replaced element
    according to the ''auto'' width and height calculations.

Intrinsic Sizes in Multi-column Layout</h3>

  <p>The <i>min-content</i> and <i>max-content</i> sizes of a multi-column
    element are undefined per [[!CSS3COL]]. A future specification may
    define them.

Intrinsic Sizes for Multi-column Elements</h4>

  <p class="issue">This section is under discussion and may be removed</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>min-content</dt>
    <dd>The <i>min-content</i> measure of the multi-column element is
      the <i>min-content</i> measure of the multi-column element's
      contents.
    <dt>max-content</dt>
  </dl>

  <p>For multi-column elements laid out with infinite available measure (see
    <a href="#orthogonal-multicol">Multi-column Layout in Orthogonal Flows</a>),
    the <i>min-content</i> extent is the extent that would result
    from taking every permissible pagination break as a column break, and the
    <i>max-content</i> extent is the extent that would result from taking
    only the forced breaks. For all other multi-column elements it is, like
    CSS2.1 block-level boxes, the extent that would be calculated for an
    ''auto'' extent per [[CSS3MULTICOL]].

NOTES FROM ROSSEN:
  min-content measure is min(column-width, min-content)
  max-content measure is
    1. Pass w/ colspans displ: none;
       Get width
    2. Pass with colspans only in width
       Get remaining height
    3. Pass w/ spans again using remaining height
       Get width
    4. Layout in width as final
    Will lay out perfectly without colspans; will have some slack but no
    overflow when colspans present.

      of the multi-column element's contents.
    <dt>''max-content''
    <dd>Specifies the optimal column width as the <i>max-content measure</i>

    <dt>''fill-available''
    <dd>Specifies the optimal column width as the <i>fill-available measure</i>
      of the multi-column element.
    <dt>''fit-content''
    <dd>Specifies the optimal column width as
