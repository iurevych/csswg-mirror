- Zero times now have the unit specifier (dbaron feedback 11 April)

2011-04-05 dino@apple.com

Changes from David Baron's feedback

- describe that animationstart event fires after delay has expired
  either with a zero elapsedTime (in the case where delay >= 0) or
  -1 * delay (in the case where delay < 0)
- if the same property is animated in multiple animations, then the
  animation-name closest to the end of the list wins.
- animation-name is the dominant property for lists. Every other property
  repeats to fill whatever animation-name requires.
- insertRule is now appendRule (always appends, does not replace)
- describe that animations with a 0 duration still respect fill mode, delay
  and fire events.

- list stepped timing functions

- Better start to the Keyframes section
- Example 1 changed to use an identifier, rather than a string for the keyframes name.
- Changed paragraph stating that 'from' and 'to' keyframes are required to say that these
  are implied if missing, using the computed values. Added ISSUE related to repeating animations.
- Added NOTE to clarify behavior when a property is not specified in all keyframes.
- Move the contents Animation Behavior section into the Animation section, so we introduce general
animation behavior before diving into keyframes.
