- made it clear that shorthand accepts duration before delay
  but also noted the request for 1s/2s type syntax
- space-separated lists of animatable property values are only
  interpolated if the lists have the same number of elements
- noted that the TransitionEvent is for notification, and thus
  has no default action (ie. cancelling the event doesn't really
  do anything)
- added elapsedTime to the context info of the TransitionEvent
- made it clear that transition events do not fire if the transition
  is cancelled (say if the transition-property is changed)
- described that shorthand properties can be animated
- referenced the SVG specification for the list of SVG properties that
  can be animated
- changed transition properties from "visual" media to "interactive",
  which means they do not apply to print
- noted that lists in transition properties repeat as a whole in order
  to provide necessary values
- added apostrophes into the property definitions (as reported by Ã˜yvind)
- noted that shadow lists only interpolate when there are the same number
  of elements in the list
- Changes properties applying to "block-level and inline-level elements" to
  "all elements".
- Transitions also apply to :before and :after pseudo elements
