<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured
<span>documents</span> (such as HTML
and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc.
This draft contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to
borders and backgrounds. It includes and extends the functionality of
CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1
[[CSS1]]. The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are borders
consisting of images, boxes with multiple backgrounds, boxes with
rounded corners and boxes with shadows.

<p>This module replaces two earlier drafts: CSS3 Backgrounds and CSS3
Border.



<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="status">Status of this document</h2>
<!--status-->

<p class=issue>The CSS WG maintains an <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/products/11">issues
list</a> for this module. <strong>If there's a conflict between
CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3 and CSS 2.1, please report
it to the CSS Working Group. Since these specs are intended to
be consistent with each other, conflicts indicate an error in one
or both specs.</strong>

<p>The following features are at-risk and may be dropped at the
end of the CR period if there has not been enough interest from
implementers: 'box-break'.

<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="contents">Table of contents</h2>
<!--toc-->



<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

<p>When elements are rendered according to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html">CSS box model</a> [[!CSS21]],
each element is either not displayed at all, or formatted as one
or more rectangular boxes. Each box has a rectangular content
area, a band of padding around the content, a border around the
padding, and a margin outside the border. (The margin may actually be
negative, but margins have no influence on the background and border.)

<div class="figure">
  <p><img src="box" alt="Diagram of a typical box, showing the
  content, padding, border and margin areas">

  <p class="caption">The various areas and edges of a typical box.
  (This diagram is explained in the CSS2.1 Box Model chapter [[!CSS21]].)
</div>

<p>The properties of this module deal with the decoration of the border
area and with the background of the content, padding and border areas.
<!-- Additionally the box may be given a "drop-shadow" effect with the
'box-shadow' property. -->

<p>If an element is broken into multiple boxes, 'box-break' defines
how the borders and background are divided over the various boxes.
(An element can result in more than one box if it is broken at the
end of a line, at the end of a column or at the end of a page; and
continued in the next line, column or page.)

<p>The relative stacking order of backgrounds, borders, and shadows
is given in this module. For how these layers interact with other
rendered content, see Appendix E “Elaborate description of Stacking
Contexts” in [[!CSS21]].



<h2 id="values">Values</h2>

<p>This specification follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].</p>

<p><dfn><var>&lt;color&gt;</var></dfn> values are defined in CSS Color
Level 3 [[!CSS3COLOR]].</p>

<p><dfn><var>&lt;image&gt;</var></dfn> values are defined by this
specification as <code class=prod><var>&lt;image&gt;</var> =
<var>&lt;uri&gt;</var></code>.</p>

<p class="note">A future specification may expand the definition of
<var>&lt;image&gt;</var> to allow other values, e.g., to define image
slices.</p>

<p>All other values are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].</p>

<p>All properties defined in this specification also accept the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
keyword as their value, but for readability it has not been listed explicitly.

<h2 id="backgrounds">Background properties</h2>

<p>Each box has a background layer that may be fully transparent (the
default), or filled with a color and/or one or more images. The background
properties specify what color ('background-color')
and images ('background-image') to use,
and how they are sized, positioned, tiled, etc.

<p>The background properties are not inherited, but the parent box's
background will shine through by default because of the initial
'transparent' value on 'background-color'.

<h3 id="layering">Layering multiple background images</h3>

<p>The background of a box can have multiple <span
class=index>layers</span> in CSS3. The number
of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the
'background-image' property. Note that a value of 'none' still creates
a layer.

<p>Each of the images is sized, positioned, and tiled according to
the corresponding value in the other background properties. The lists
are matched up from the first value: excess values at the end are not
used. If a property doesn't have enough comma-separated values to match
the number of layers, the <span>UA</span> must calculate its used
value by repeating
the list of values until there are enough.

<div class="example">
<p>For example, this set of declarations:
<pre>
background-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass.png);
background-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left, bottom right;
background-origin: border-box, content-box;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
</pre>
<p>has exactly the same effect as this set with the extra position
dropped and the missing values for 'background-origin' and
'background-repeat' filled in (emphasized for clarity):
<pre>
background-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass1.png);
background-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left;
background-origin: border-box, content-box<strong>, border-box</strong>;
background-repeat: no-repeat<strong>, no-repeat, no-repeat</strong>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first image in the list is the layer closest to the user,
the next one is painted behind the first, and so on. The background
color, if present, is painted below all of the other layers.

<p class="note">Note that the <a href="#border-images">border-image properties</a>
can also define a background image, which, if present, is painted on top of
the background created by the background properties.

<h3 id="the-background-color">The 'background-color' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-color</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td><var>&lt;color&gt;</var>
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>transparent
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>the computed color(s)
</table>

<p>This property sets the <span class=index
title="color!!background">background color</span> of an element. The
color is drawn behind any background images.

<div class="example">
<p>Example:
<pre>h1 { background-color: #F00 } /* Sets background to red. */</pre>
</div>

<p>The background color is clipped according to the 'background-clip'
value associated with the bottom-most background image.

<h3 id="the-background-image">The 'background-image' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-image</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td><var>&lt;bg-image&gt;</var>
	[ , <var>&lt;bg-image&gt;</var> ]*
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified, but with URIs made absolute
</table>

<p>This property sets the background image(s) of an element. Images
are drawn with the first specified one on top (closest to the user)
and each subsequent image behind the previous one.
Where

<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;bg-image&gt;</var></dfn> = <var>&lt;image&gt;</var> | none</pre>

<p>A value of <dfn title="''none''!!'background-image' value">''none''</dfn>
counts as an image layer but draws
nothing. An image that is empty (zero width or zero height), that
fails to download, or that cannot be displayed (e.g., because it is
not in a supported image format) likewise counts as a layer but
draws nothing.

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-image' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

<p>When setting a background image, authors should also specify a
''background-color'' that will preserve contrast with the text for
when the image is unavailable.

<div class="example">
<p>Some examples specifying background images:</p>
<pre>
body { background-image: url("marble.svg") }
p { background-image: none }
div { background-image: url(tl.png), url(tr.png) }
</pre>
</div>

<p class=note>Implementations may optimize by not downloading and
drawing images that are not visible (e.g., because they are behind
other, fully opaque images).



<h3 id="the-background-repeat">The 'background-repeat' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-repeat</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:

    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified
</table>

<p>Specifies how background images are tiled after they have been
<a href="#the-background-size">sized</a> and <a href="#the-background-position">positioned</a>.
Where
<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;repeat-style&gt;</var></dfn> = repeat-x | repeat-y | [repeat | space | round | no-repeat]{1,2}</pre>

<p>Single values for <var>&lt;repeat-style&gt;</var> have the following
meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>''repeat-x''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''repeat no-repeat''.

  <dt><dfn>''repeat-y''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''no-repeat repeat''.

  <dt>''repeat''
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''repeat repeat''.

  <dt>''no-repeat''
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''no-repeat no-repeat''

  <dt>''space''
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''space space''

  <dt>''round''
  <dd>
  Equivalent to ''round round''
</dl>

<p>If a <var>&lt;repeat-style&gt;</var> value has two keywords, the first
one is for the horizontal direction, the second for the vertical one,
as follows:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn title="''repeat''!!'background-repeat' value">''repeat''</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated in this direction as often as needed to cover
  the <span class=index>background painting area.</span>

  <dt><dfn title="''no-repeat''!!'background-repeat' value">''no-repeat''</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is placed once and not repeated in this direction.

  <dt><dfn title="''space''!!'background-repeat' value">''space''</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated as often as will fit within the
  <span class=index>background positioning area</span> without being
  clipped and then the images are spaced out to fill the area. The
  first and last images touch the edges of the area. If the background
  painting area is larger than the background positioning area, then
  the pattern repeats to fill the background painting area.
  The value of 'background-position' for this direction
  is ignored, unless there is not enough space for two copies of the
  image in this direction, in which case only one image is placed and
  'background-position' determines its position in this
  direction.

  <dt><dfn title="''round''!!'background-repeat' value">''round''</dfn>
  <dd>
  The image is repeated as often as will fit within the
  <span>background positioning area.</span> If it doesn't
  fit a whole number of times, it is rescaled so that it does.
  See the formula under 'background-size'. If the background
  painting area is larger than the background positioning area, then
  the pattern repeats to fill the background painting area.
</dl>

<p>Unless one of the two keywords is ''no-repeat'', the
whole background painting area will be tiled, i.e., not just one
vertical strip and one horizontal strip.

<div class="example">
<p style="display:none">Example(s):
<pre>
body {
  background: white url("pendant.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-position: center;
}
</pre>

<div class="figure">
  <p><img src="bg-repeat" alt="A centered background image, with
  copies repeated up and down the border, padding and content
  areas."><!--<SPAN class="dlink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
  name="img-bg-repeat" href="images/longdesc/bg-repeat-desc.html"
  title="Long description for background pattern">[D]</A></SPAN>-->

  <p class="caption">The effect of ''repeat-y'': One copy
  of the background image is centered, and other copies are put above
  and below it to make a vertical band behind the element.
</div>
</div>

<div class=example>
  <p style="display:none">Example(s):
  <pre>
body {
  background-image: url(dot.png) white;
  background-repeat: space
}
</pre>

  <div class=figure>
    <p><img src="bg-space" alt="Image of an element with a dotted background">

    <p class=caption>The effect of 'space': the image of a dot is
    tiled to cover the whole background and the images are equally
    spaced.
  </div>
</div>

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-repeat' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.



<h3 id="the-background-attachment">The 'background-attachment' property</h3>

<table class="propdef">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>background-attachment</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td><var>&lt;attachment&gt;</var>	[ , <var>&lt;attachment&gt;</var> ]*
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed value:
      <td>as specified
</table>

<p>If background images are specified, this property specifies whether
they are fixed with regard to the <em class="index">viewport</em>
(<dfn>''fixed''</dfn>) or scroll along with the element (<dfn>''scroll''</dfn>
and <dfn>''local''</dfn>).
Where

<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;attachment&gt;</var></dfn> = scroll | fixed | local</pre>

<p>Note that there is only one viewport per view. If an element has a
scrolling mechanism (see  the 'overflow' property [[!CSS21]]), a
''fixed'' background doesn't move with the element, and
a ''scroll''
background doesn't move with the scrolling mechanism.

<p>The difference between ''scroll'' and ''local'' is only visible
when the element has a scrolling mechanism: in the case of
''scroll'', the background does not scroll with the element's
content. (It is attached to the element's border, effectively.) In the
case of ''local'', the background scrolls along with the element's
content. In this case, the background behind the element's border (if any)
scrolls as well, even though the border itself does not scroll with the
contents. The UA may, however, treat the ''border-box'' value of
'background-clip' as ''padding-box'' in cases where 'background-attachment'
is ''local'' and the contents of the element scroll.

<p>In paged media where there is no viewport, a ''fixed'' background
is fixed with respect to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html#page-box">page
box</a>.

<p>Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible when it is in
the <em>background painting area</em> of the element or otherwise
unclipped. (See <a href="#special-backgrounds"> “The backgrounds of
special elements”</a> for the cases when background images are not
clipped.) Thus, unless the image is tiled, it may be invisible.

<div class="example">
<p>This example creates an infinite vertical band that remains
“glued” to the viewport when the element is scrolled.

<pre>
body {
  background: red url("pendant.gif");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>User agents that do not support ''fixed'' backgrounds (for
example due to limitations of the hardware platform) should ignore
declarations with the keyword ''fixed''. For example:

<pre class=example>
body {
   /* For all UAs: */
   background: white url(paper.png) scroll;
   /* For UAs that do fixed backgrounds: */
   background: white url(ledger.png) fixed;
}
h1 {
   /* For all UAs: */
   background: silver;
   /* For UAs that do fixed backgrounds: */
   background: url(stripe.png) fixed, white url(ledger.png) fixed;
}
</pre>

<p>See the section <a href="#layering">“Layering multiple background
images”</a> for how 'background-attachment' interacts with other
comma-separated background properties to form each background image
layer.

</table>

<p>If background images have been specified, this property specifies
their initial position (after any <a href="#the-background-size">resizing</a>)
within their corresponding <span>background positioning area.</span>

<p>Where
<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;bg-position&gt;</var></dfn> = [
  [ [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | left | center | right ] ]

  [ center | [ top | bottom ] [ <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> | <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> ]? ]
]</pre>

<p>If only one value is specified, the second value is assumed to be
'center'. If two values are given and at least one value is not a keyword,
then the first value represents the horizontal position (or offset) and
the second represents the vertical position (or
offset). <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> and <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>
values here represent an offset of the top left corner
of the background image from the top left corner of the background
positioning area.

<p>If three or four values are given, then
each <var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var> or<var>&lt;length&gt;</var>
represents an offset and must be preceded by a keyword,
which specifies from which edge the offset is given. For example,
''background-position: bottom 10px right 20px'' represents a
''10px'' vertical offset up from the bottom edge and a
''20px'' horizontal offset leftward from the right edge. If
three values are given, the missing offset is assumed to be zero.

<p>Positive values represent an offset <em>inward</em> from the edge of
the background positioning area. Negative values represent an offset
<em>outward</em> from the edge of the background positioning area.

<div class="example">
  <p>The following declarations give the stated (horizontal, vertical)
    offsets from the top left corner:</p>
  <pre>
 background-position: left 10px top 15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
 background-position: left      top     ;   /*  0px,  0px */
 background-position:      10px     15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
 background-position: left          15px;   /*  0px, 15px */
 background-position:      10px top     ;   /* 10px,  0px */
 background-position: left      top 15px;   /*  0px, 15px */
 background-position: left 10px top     ;   /* 10px,  0px */</pre>
</div>

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var>

  <dd><p>A percentage for the horizontal offset is relative to (<var>width of
    background positioning area</var> - <var>width of background image</var>).
    A percentage for the vertical offset is relative to (<var>height
    of background
    positioning area</var> - <var>height of background image</var>), where the
    size of the image is the size given by 'background-size'.
    <div class=example>
      <p>For example, with a value pair of ''0% 0%'', the upper left
      corner of the image is aligned with the upper left corner of, usually,
      the box's padding edge. A value pair of ''100% 100%'' places
      the lower right corner of the image in the lower right corner of the
      area. With a value pair of ''75% 50%'', the point 75% across
      and 50% down the image is to be placed at the point 75% across and 50%
      down the area.

    </div>

  <dt><var>&lt;length&gt;</var>

  <dd>A length value gives a fixed length as the offset. For example, with a
    value pair of ''2cm 1cm'', the upper left corner of the image
    is placed 2cm to the right and 1cm below the upper left corner of the

<p>Values have the following meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>''contain''</dfn></dt>
  <dd>Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio
    (if any), to the largest size such that both its width and its

  | <dfn title="''auto''!!'background-size' value">auto</dfn> ]{1,2}</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The first value gives the width of the corresponding image,
    the second value its height. If only one value is given the second
    is assumed to be ''auto''.

    <p>A percentage is relative to the background positioning area.

    <p>An ''auto'' value for one dimension is resolved by using the
    image's intrinsic ratio and the size of the other dimension, or
    failing that, using the image's intrinsic size, or failing that,
    treating it as 100%.

    <p>If both values are ''auto'' then the intrinsic width and/or
    height of the image should be used, if any<!--, the missing dimension
    (if any) behaving as ''auto'' as described above-->. If the image has
    neither an intrinsic width nor an intrinsic height, its size is
    determined as for ''contain''.

    <p>Negative values are not allowed.
  </dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
<p>Here are some examples. The first example stretches the background
image independently in both dimensions to completely cover the content
area:

<pre>
div {
    background-image: url(plasma.png);
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    background-origin: content-box }
</pre>

<p>The second example stretches the image so that exactly two copies
fit horizontally. The aspect ratio is preserved:

<pre>
p {
    background-image: url(tubes.png);
    background-size: 50% auto;
    background-origin: border-box }
</pre>

<p>This example forces the background image to be 15 by 15 pixels:

<pre>
para {
    background-size: 15px 15px;
    background-image: url(tile.png)}
</pre>

<p>This example uses the image's intrinsic size. Note that this is the
only possible behavior in CSS level&nbsp;1 and 2.

<pre>
body {
    background-size: auto;            /* default */
    background-image: url(flower.png) }
</pre>

<p>The following example rounds the height of the image to 25%, down
from the specified value of 30%. At 30%, three images would fit
entirely and a fourth only partially. After rounding, four images
fit. The width of the image is 20% of the background area width and is
not rounded.

<pre>
p {
    background-image: url(chain.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat round;
    background-size: 20% 30% }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If 'background-repeat' is ''round'' for one (or both) dimensions,
there is a second step. The UA must scale the image in that dimension
(or both dimensions) so that it fits a whole number of times in
the background positioning area. In the case of the width (height is
analogous):

<blockquote>
  <p>If <var>X</var> &ne; 0 is the width of the image after step one
  and <var>W</var> is the width of the background positioning area,
  then the rounded width
  <var>X'</var> = <var>W</var> / round(<var>W</var> / <var>X</var>)
  where round() is a function that returns the nearest natural number.
</blockquote>

<p>If 'background-repeat' is ''round'' for one dimension only and if
'background-size' is ''auto'' for the other dimension, then there is a third
step: that other dimension is scaled so that the original aspect ratio
is restored.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example the background image is shown at its intrinsic size:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image1.png);
  background-repeat: repeat;         /* default */
  background-size: auto }            /* default */
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background is shown with a width of
3em and its height is scaled proportionally to keep the original
aspect ratio:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image2.png);
  background-repeat: repeat;         /* default */
  background-size: 3em }             /* = '3em auto' */
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background is shown with a width of
3em or slightly smaller, so that it fits a whole number of times in
the width of the background. The height is scaled proportionally to
keep the original aspect ratio:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image3.png);
  background-repeat: round repeat;
  background-size: 3em auto }
</pre>

<p>In the following example, the background image is shown with a
width of 3em and a height that is either the height corresponding to
that width at the original aspect ratio or slightly less:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image4.png);
  background-repeat: repeat round;
  background-size: 3em auto }
</pre>
<p>In the following example, the background image is shown with a
height of 4em or slightly less, so that it fits a whole number of
times in the background height. The width is the width that correspond
to a 4em height at the original aspect ratio or slightly less:

<pre>
div {
  background-image: url(image5.png);
  background-repeat: round;
  background-size: auto 4em }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If the background image's width or height resolves to zero, this
causes the image not to be displayed. (The effect is the same as
if it had been a transparent image.)

<p class=note>Note that a color is permitted in

<p>The 'background' property is a
shorthand property for setting most background properties at the same
place in the style sheet. Given a valid declaration, the shorthand first
sets each of
'background-color',
'background-position',
'background-size',
'background-repeat',
'background-origin',
'background-clip',
'background-attachment' and
'background-image' to its initial value, then assigns explicit values
given in the declaration.

<p>If 'background-origin' is present and its value matches a possible
value for 'background-clip' then it also sets 'background-clip' to
that value. For example, ''background: border-box'' sets both
'background-origin' and 'background-clip' to ''border-box''.

<div class="example">
<p style="display:none">Examples:

<p>In the first rule of the following example, only a value for
'background-color' has been given and the

<pre>
body { background: red }
p { background: url("chess.png") / 10em gray
       40% round fixed border border}
</pre>

<p>The first rule is equivalent to:

    background-position: 0% 0%;
    background-size: auto auto;
    background-repeat: repeat repeat;
    background-clip: border-box;
    background-origin: padding-box;
    background-attachment: scroll;
    background-image: none }

<p>The second is equivalent to:

<pre>
p {

    background-position: 40% 50%;
    background-size: 10em 10em;
    background-repeat: round round;
    background-clip: border-box;
    background-origin: border-box;
    background-attachment: fixed;

<p class=note>Note that ''background: url(foo)
white'' and ''background: url(foo), white''
have the same effect.



<h3 id="special-backgrounds">The backgrounds of special elements</h3>

<p>The background of the root element becomes the background of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#the-canvas">canvas</a>
and its <em>background painting area</em> extends to
cover the entire canvas, although any images are sized and positioned
relative to the root element as if they were painted for that element
alone. (In other words, the background <em>positioning</em> area is
determined as for the root element.) If the root's 'background-color'
value is ''transparent'', the canvas's background color is UA dependent.
The root element does not paint this background again, i.e., the used
value of its background is transparent.

<p>For documents whose root element is an HTML <code class="html">HTML</code>
element or an XHTML <code class="html">html</code> element: if the computed
value of 'background-image' on the root element is ''none'' and its
'background-color' is ''transparent'', user agents must instead propagate
the computed values of the background properties from that element's first
HTML <code class="html">BODY</code>, respectively, XHTML <code
class="html">body</code> child
element. The used values of that <code class="html">BODY</code> element's
background properties are their initial values, and the propagated values
are treated as if they were specified on the root element.
It is recommended that authors of HTML documents specify the canvas background
for the <code class=html>BODY</code> element rather than the
<code class=html>HTML</code> element.

<div class="example">
<p>According to these rules, the canvas underlying the following HTML
document will have a “marble” background:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN'
  &gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Setting the canvas background&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
       body { background: url("http://example.org/marble.png") }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My background is marble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The ''::first-line'' pseudo-element is like an inline-level element
for the purposes of the background (see section 5.12.1 of [[!CSS21]]). 
That means, e.g., that in a left-justified first line, the background
does not necessarily extend all the way to the right margin.

<h2 id="borders">Border properties</h2>

<p>The border can either be a predefined style (solid line, double
line, dotted line, pseudo-3D border, etc.) or it can be an image. In
the former case, various properties define the style ('border-style'),
color ('border-color'), and thickness ('border-width') of the border.

right, a missing bottom is the same as top, and a missing right is
also the same as top.

<p>These properties set the style of the border, unless there is a
<a href="#border-images">border image</a>

<p>'Border-style' is a shorthand for the
other four. Its four values set the top, right, bottom and left border
respectively. A missing left is the same as right, a missing bottom is
the same as top, and a missing right is also the same as top.

<p>Where
<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;border-style&gt;</var></dfn> = none | hidden | dotted | dashed | solid | double | groove | ridge | inset | outset</pre>

<p>Values have the following meanings:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn title="''none''!!'border-style' value">''none''</dfn>
  <dd>
  No border. Color and width are ignored (i.e., the border has width
  0, unless the border is an image, see
  'background-image'

  <dt><dfn>''hidden''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Same as 'none', but has different behavior in the border conflict
  resolution rules for border-collapsed tables [[!CSS21]].

  <dt><dfn>''dotted''</dfn>
  <dd>
  A series of round dots.

  <dt><dfn>''dashed''</dfn>
  <dd>
  A series of square-ended dashes.

  <dt><dfn>''solid''</dfn>
  <dd>
  A single line segment.

  <dt><dfn>''double''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Two parallel solid lines with some space between them. (The
  thickness of the lines is not specified, but the sum of the lines
  and the space must equal
  'border-width'.)

  <dt><dfn>''groove''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if it were carved in the canvas. (This is typically
  achieved by creating a “shadow” from two colors that are
  slightly lighter and darker than the
  'border-color'.)

  <dt><dfn>''ridge''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if it were coming out of the canvas.

  <dt><dfn>''inset''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if the content on the inside of the border is sunken into the
  canvas. Treated as 'ridge' in border-collapsed tables. [[!CSS21]]

  <dt><dfn>''outset''</dfn>
  <dd>
  Looks as if the content on the inside of the border is coming out of
  the canvas. Treated as 'groove' in border-collapsed tables. [[!CSS21]]

<p>Borders are drawn in front of the element's background, but behind
the element's content (in case it overlaps).

<p>The <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> may not be
negative. The lengths corresponding to ''thin'', ''medium'' and
''thick'' are not specified, but the values are constant throughout a
<span>document</span> and thin &le; medium &le; thick. A UA could,
e.g., make the thickness depend on the ''medium'' font size: one
choice might be 1, 3 &amp; 5px when the 'medium' font size is 17px or
less.

<p>'Border-width' is a shorthand that sets the
four 'border-*-width' properties. If it has four values, they set top, right,
bottom and left in that order. If left is missing, it is the same as right;
if bottom is missing, it is the same as top; if right is missing, it is the
same as top.

<p class="note">Note that the initial width is 'medium', but the initial
style is 'none' and therefore the used width is 0.

<p>When the used width of the border is 0, we say that the border is
absent.

<p>The two length values of the 'border-*-radius' properties define
the radii of a quarter ellipse that defines the shape of the corner
of the outer border edge (see the diagram below).
The first value is the horizontal radius. If the
second length is omitted it is equal to the first (and the corner is
thus a quarter circle). If either length is zero, the corner is
square, not rounded.

<p>The 'border-radius' shorthand sets all four 'border-*-radius'
properties. If values are given before and after the slash, then
the values before the slash set the horizontal radius and the values
after the slash set the vertical radius. If there is no slash, then the
values set both radii equally. The four values for each radii are
given in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.
If bottom-left is omitted it is the same as top-right. If
bottom-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. If top-right is
omitted it is the same as top-left.

<div class="example">
<pre>
border-radius: 4em;
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
border-top-left-radius:     4em;
border-top-right-radius:    4em;
border-bottom-right-radius: 4em;
border-bottom-left-radius:  4em;
</pre>
and
<pre>
border-radius: 2em 1em 4em / 0.5em 3em;
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
border-top-left-radius:     2em 0.5em;
border-top-right-radius:    1em 3em;
border-bottom-right-radius: 4em 0.5em;
border-bottom-left-radius:  1em 3em;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The padding edge (inner border) radius is the outer border radius
minus the corresponding border thickness. In the case where this results
in a negative value, the inner radius is zero. (In such cases its center
might not coincide with that of the outer border curve.) Likewise the
content edge radius is the padding edge radius minus the corresponding
padding, or if that is negative, zero. Thus when two adjoining borders
are of different thicknesses the corner will show a smooth transition
between the thicker and thinner borders.

<p>All border styles (''solid'', ''dotted'',  ''inset'', etc.)
follow the curve of the border.

<p>Backgrounds, but not the <a href="#the-border-image">border-image</a>,
are clipped to the appropriate curve (as determined by 'background-clip').
Other effects that clip to the border or padding edge (such as 'overflow'
other than ''visible'') also must clip to the curve. The content of
replaced elements is always trimmed to the content edge curve.

<div class="figure">
  <p><img alt="Diagram of the inscribed ellips" src="corner.png">

  <p class=caption>The two values of
  ''border-top-left-radius: 55pt 25pt'' define the

  <p class=caption>The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders
  it connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a
  rounded corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the
  corner (right).
</div>

<p>The center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders
is at the point on the curve that is at an angle that is proportional
to the ratio of the border widths. For example, if the two widths are
equal, that point is at a 45&deg; angle, and if one is twice the width
of the other the point is at a 30&deg; angle. The line demarcating this
transition is drawn between the point at that angle on the outer curve
and the point at that angle on the inner curve.

<p>Color and style transitions must be contained within the segment of
the border that intersects the smallest rectangle that contains both
border radii as well as the center of the inner curve (which may be a
point representing the corner of the padding edge, if the border radii
are smaller than the border-width).

<p>It is not defined what these transitions look like, but a gradient
is recommended for color transitions that don't involve dotted or dashed
borders.

<div class="figure">
  <p><img alt="Illustration of the transition region on curved corners"
  src="transition-region.png">

  <p class=caption>Given these corner shapes, color and style transitions
    must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle
    defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner
    curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded
    to include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition
    region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition
    between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded
    by the tips of the outer radii and the center of the inner curve
    (represented in case D by the dark green region).
</div>

<p>Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent corner
radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce all
corner radii until none of them overlap. The algorithm for reducing radii
is as follows:

<p>Let <var>f</var> = min(<var>L<sub>i</sub></var>/<var>S<sub>i</sub></var>),
where <var>i</var> ∈ {top, right, bottom, left},
<var>S<sub>i</sub></var> is the sum of the radii of the corners on
side <var>i</var>, and <var>L<sub>top</sub></var> =
<var>L<sub>bottom</sub></var> = the width of the box, and
<var>L<sub>left</sub></var> = <var>L<sub>right</sub></var> = the
height of the box. If <var>f</var> &lt; 1, then all corner radii are
reduced by multiplying them by <var>f</var>.

<p class=note>Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles
remain quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller
ones, but it may reduce corners that were already small enough, which
may make borders of nearby elements that should look the same look
different.

<p>If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA
may further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and
only the affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more.

<div class=example>
<p>For example, the borders A and D of the <a
href="#reduced-radius">figure below</a> might be the
result of
<pre>
box-width: border-box;
width: 6em;
height: 2.5em;
border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em
</pre>
<p>The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus
2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em,
<pre>
box-width: border-box;
width: 6em;
height: 2em;
border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em
</pre>
<p>all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make
them fit. The used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and
1.6em (instead of 2em). See borders B and C in the figure.

<div class=figure id=reduced-radius>
  <p><img src="corner-large-mix" alt="[image: rectangle with two tiny
  rounded corners and two very large ones, on opposite corners]">

  <p class=caption>These rounded corner might be the result of 'width:
  6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em' for A and
  D; and ditto but with 'height: 2em' for B and C.
</div>
</div>

<p>The UA may apply the border-radius properties to ''table'' and
''inline-table'' elements when 'border-collapse' is ''collapse'' but is
not required to. In this case not only must the border radii of adjacent
corners not intersect, but the horizontal and vertical radii of a single
corner may not extend past the boundaries of the cell at that corner
(i.e. the cell's other corners must not be affected by this corner's
border-radius). If the computed values of the border radii would cause
this effect, then the used values of all the border radii of the table
must be reduced by the same factor so that the radii neither intersect
nor extend past the boundaries of their respective corner cells.

<p>CSS3 UAs should ignore border-radius properties applied to internal
table elements when 'border-collapse' is ''collapse''.
The effect of border-radius on internal table elements is undefined in
CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders, but may be defined in a future specification.

<div class=example>
<p>This example draws ovals of 15em wide and 10em high:

<pre>
DIV.standout {
    width: 13em;
    height: 8em;
    border: solid black 1em;
    border-radius: 7.5em 5em }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>This example adds appropriate padding, so that the
contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border,
but the background will still have rounded corners.

<pre>
DIV {
    background: black;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 1em;
    padding: 1em }
</pre>

<p>The 'border' property is a shorthand property for setting the same width,
color, and style for all four borders of a box. Unlike the shorthand 'margin'
and 'padding' properties, the 'border' property cannot set different values
on the four borders. To do so, one or more of the other border properties must
be used.

<p>The 'border' shorthand also resets 'border-image' to its initial value.
It is therefore recommended that authors use the 'border' shorthand, rather
than other shorthands or the individual properties, to override any border
settings earlier in the cascade. This will ensure that 'border-image' has
also been reset to allow the new styles to take effect.

<p class="note">The CSS Working Group intends for the 'border' shorthand to
reset all border properties in future levels of CSS as well. For example, if a
'border-characters' property is introduced in the future to allow glyphs as
borders, it will also be reset by the 'border' shorthand. By using the 'border'
shorthand to reset borders, authors can be guaranteed a “blank canvas” no
matter what properties are introduced in the future.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>For example, the first rule below is equivalent to the set of four
rules shown after it:

<pre>
p { border: solid red }
p {
  border-top: solid red;
  border-right: solid red;
  border-bottom: solid red;
  border-left: solid red;
  border-image: none;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Since, to some extent, the properties have overlapping
functionality, the order in which the rules are specified is
important.

<div class="example">
<p>Consider this example:
<pre>
blockquote {
  border-color: red;
  border-left: double;
  color: black
}
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the color of the left border is black, while
the other borders are red. This is due to
'border-left' setting the width, style, and
color. Since the color value is not given by the
'border-left' property, it will be taken from
the 'color' property. The fact that the
'color' property is set after the
'border-left' property is not relevant.
</div>

<h2 id="border-images">Border Images</h2>

<p>Authors can specify an image to be used in place of the border styles.
In this case, the border's design is taken from the sides and corners
of an image specified with 'border-image-source', whose pieces may be
sliced, scaled and stretched in various ways to fit the size of the
<em>border image area.</em> The border-image properties do not affect layout:
layout of the box, its content, and surrounding content is based on
the 'border-width' and 'border-style' properties only.

<div class=example>
<p>This example creates a top and bottom border consisting of a whole
number of orange diamonds and a left and right border of a single,
stretched diamond. The corners are diamonds of a different color. The
image to tile is as follows. Apart from the diamonds, it is
transparent:

<p><img src="border.png" alt="Tile for border">

<p>The image is 81 by 81 pixels and has to be divided into 9 equal
parts. The style rules could thus be as follows:

<pre>
DIV {
  border-image: url("border.png") 27 round stretch;
  border: double orange 1em }
</pre>

<p>The result, when applied to a DIV of 12 by 5em, will be similar to
this:

<p><img src="borderresult.png" alt="element with a diamond border">
</div>

<div class="example">
  <p>This shows a more complicated example, demonstrating how the border
  image corresponds to the fallback border-style but can also extend
  beyond the border area. The border image is a wavy green border with
  an extended corner effect:</p>
  <div class=figure>

    <p><img src="groovy-border-image-slice.png" alt="Diagram: The
      border image shows a wavy green border with more exaggerated
      waves towards the corners, which are capped by a disconnected
      green circle. Four cuts at 124px offsets from each side divide
      the image into 124px-wide square corners, 124px-wide but thin
      side slices, and a small center square.">

    <p class="caption">The 'border-image-source' image, with the four
      'border-image-slice' cuts at 124px diving the image into nine parts.</p>

  <p>The rest of the border properties then interact to lay out the
  tiles as follows:</p>

  <div class=figure>
    <p><img src="border-image.png" alt="Diagram: The image-less (fallback)
    rendering has a green double border. The rendering with border-image
    shows the wavy green border, with the waves getting longer as they
    reach the corners. The corner tiles render as 124px-wide squares and
    the side tiles repeat a whole number of times to fill the space in
    between. Because of the gradual corner effects, the tiles extend deep
    into the padding area. The whole border image effect is outset 31px, so
    that the troughs of the waves align just outside the padding edge.">

    <p class=caption>Diagram of all border-image properties and how they
    interact, and showing the rendering with and without the border-image
    in effect.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Here, even though the border-width is 12px, the 'border-image-width'
  property computes to 124px. The border-image area is then outset 31px
  from the border-box and into the margin area. If the border-image fails
  to load (or border images are not supported by the UA), the fallback
  rendering uses a green double border.

<p>The four 'border-image-slice' values represent inward offsets from
the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the image respectively,
dividing it into nine regions: four corners, four edges and a middle.
The middle image part is discarded (treated as fully transparent)
unless the ''fill'' keyword is present. (It is drawn over the background;
see the <a href="#border-image-process">border-image drawing process</a>.)

<p>If the fourth number/percentage is absent, it is the same as the
second. If the third one is also absent, it is the same as the first.
If the second one is also absent, it is the same as the first.

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var>
  <dd>Percentages are relative to the size of the image: the width
    of the image for the horizontal offsets, the height for vertical
    offsets.

    image) or vector coordinates (if the image is a vector image).

  <dt><dfn id="border-image-slice-fill">''fill''</dfn>
  <dd>The ''fill'' keyword, if present, causes the middle part of
    the border-image to be preserved. (By default it is discarded,

</dl>

<p>Negative values are not allowed and values bigger than the size
of the image are interpreted as ''100%''.

<p>The regions given by the 'border-image-slice' values may overlap.
However if the sum of the right and left widths is equal to or
greater than the width of the image, the images for the top and
bottom edge and the middle part are empty, which has the same effect
as if a nonempty transparent image had been specified for those
parts. Analogously for the top and bottom values.

<p>The border image is drawn inside an area called the
<em>border image area</em>. This is an area whose boundaries
by default correspond to the border box, see 'border-image-outset'.

<p>The four values of 'border-image-width' specify offsets that are used
to divide the border image area into nine parts. They represent inward
distances from the the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the
area, respectively. If the fourth value is absent, it is
the same as the second. If the third one is also absent, it is the same
as the first. If the second one is also absent, it is the same as the
first. Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;percentage&gt;</var>

    instead.

<p class="issue">Are percentages of the border-image area useful? Should

<p>Negative values are not allowed for any 'border-image-width' values.

<p>If two opposite 'border-image-width' offsets are large enough that
they overlap, then the used values of all 'border-image-width' offsets
are proportionally reduced until they no longer overlap. In mathematical
notation: Given <var>L<sub>width</sub></var> as the width of the border
image area, <var>L<sub>height</sub></var> as its height, and
<var>W<sub><var>side</var></sub></var> as the border image width offset
for the <var>side</var> side, let <var>f</var> =

<var>L<sub>height</sub></var>/(<var>W<sub>top</sub></var>+<var>W<sub>bottom</sub></var>)).

<p>This property specifies how the images for the sides and the middle
part of the border image are scaled and tiled. If the second keyword is
absent, it is assumed to be the same as the first. Values have the

  <dd>The image is tiled (repeated) to fill the area. If it does not

</dl>

<p>The exact process for scaling and tiling the border-image parts is
given in the section below.</p>

<h3 id="border-image-process">Border-image drawing process</h3>

<p>After the border-image given by 'border-image-source' is sliced by
the 'border-image-slice' values, the resulting nine images are scaled,
positioned, and tiled into their corresponding border image regions
in four steps:

<ol>
<li>Scale to 'border-image-width'.
  <ul>
  <li><p>The two images for the top and bottom edges are made as tall
  as the top and bottom <em>border image area</em> parts, respectively, and
  their width is scaled proportionally.

  <li><p>The images for the left and right edge are made as wide as the
  left and right <em>border image area</em> parts, respectively, and their
  height is scaled proportionally.

  <li><p>The corner images are scaled to be as wide and as tall as the
  two border-image edges they are part of.

  <li><p>The middle image's width is scaled by the same factor as the top
  image unless that factor is zero or infinity, in which case the scaling
  factor of the bottom is substituted, and failing that, the width is not
  scaled. The height of the middle image is scaled by the same factor as
  the left image unless that factor is zero or infinity, in which case the
  scaling factor of the right image is substituted, and failing that, the
  height is not scaled.</p>
  </ul>

<li>Scale to 'border-image-repeat'.
  <ul>
  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''stretch'', the top, middle and bottom
  images are further scaled to be as wide as the middle part of the
  <span>border image area.</span> The height is not changed any further.

  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''round'', the top, middle and bottom
  images are reduced in width, so that exactly a whole number of them
  fit in the middle part of the border-image area, exactly as for
  ''round'' in the 'background-repeat' property.

  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''repeat'' or ''space'', the top, middle,
    and bottom images are not changed any further.

  <li><p>The effects of ''stretch'', ''round'', ''repeat'', and ''space''
    for the second keyword are analogous, acting on the height of the left,
    middle and right images.
  </ul>

<li>Position the first tile.
  <ul>
  <li><p>If the first keyword is ''repeat'', the top, middle, and bottom
    images are centered horizontally in their respective areas. Otherwise
    the images are placed at the left edge of their respective parts
    of the border-image area.
  <li><p>If the second keyword is ''repeat'', the left, middle, and right
    images are centered vertically in their respective areas. Otherwise
    the images are placed at the top edge of their respective parts
    of the border-image area.
  </ul>

<li>Tile and draw.
  <ul>
  <li><p>The images are then tiled to fill their respective areas. All
    images are drawn at the same stacking level as normal borders:
    immediately in front of the background layers.
  <li><p>In the case of ''space'', any partial tiles are discarded and
    the extra space distributed before, after, and between the tiles.
    (I.e. the gap before the first tile, the gap after the last tile,
    and the gaps between tiles are equalized.)
    <span class="note">This can result in empty border-image side areas.</span>

<p>When a box is broken at a page break, column break, or, for inline
elements, at a line break, the 'box-break' property specifies whether
individual boxes are treated as broken pieces of one continuous box,
or whether each box is individually wrapped with the border and padding.
For backgrounds it defines how the <span class=index>background
positioning area</span> is derived from these multiple boxes and how
the element's background is drawn within them. Values have the following
meanings:

<p class="issue">Any suggestions for better names? I think these aren't
very clear.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>''each-box''</dfn>
  <dd>Each box is independently wrapped with the border and padding.
    The 'border-radius' and 'border-image' <!--, and 'box-shadow', if any, -->
    are applied to each box independently. The background is drawn
    independently in each box of the element. A no-repeat background
    image will thus be rendered once in each box of the element.

  <dt><dfn>''continuous''</dfn>
  <dd><p>No border and no padding are inserted at the break. <!-- No box-shadow
    is drawn at the broken edge; --> 'border-radius' has no effect at its
    corners; and the 'border-image' is rendered for the whole box as if
    it were unbroken. The effect is as though the element were rendered
    with no break present, and then sliced by the break afterward.

    <p>Backgrounds are drawn as if, after the element has been laid out
    (including any justification, bidi reordering, page breaks, etc.),
    all the element's boxes are taken and put one after the other in
    visual order. The background is applied to the bounding box of
    this composite box and then the boxes are put back, with their
    share of the background.</p>

    <p>For boxes broken across lines, first boxes on the same line are
    connected in visual order. Then boxes on subsequent lines are
    ordered according to the element's inline progression direction and
    aligned on the baseline.
    For example in a left-to-right containing block ('direction' is
    ''ltr''), the first box is the leftmost box on the first line and
    boxes from subsequent lines are put to the right of it. In a
    right-to-left containing block, the first box is the rightmost on
    the first line and subsequent boxes are put to the left of it.</p>

    <p>For boxes broken across columns, the columns are treated as
    one continuous element, as if the column boxes were glued together
    in the block progression direction of the multi-column element.
    For boxes broken across pages, the page content areas are glued
    together in the block progression direction of the root element.
    In these cases, if the pieces have different widths (heights, if
    the root element / multi-column element is in vertical text mode),
    then each piece draws its background assuming that the
    whole element has the same width (height) as this piece. This
    ensures that right-aligned images stay aligned to the right edge,
    left-aligned images stay aligned to the left edge, and centered
    images stay centered.
</dl>

  <p><img alt="Illustration of box-break" src="box-break.png">

  <p class=caption>Two possibilities for
  'box-break': on the left, the value
  ''continuous'', on the right the value
  ''each-box''.
</div>

<p>For inline elements side of the box that breaks is determined
by the element's inline progression direction, not that of the
containing block. For example, the first part of an inline element
with ''direction: rtl'' inside a block with ''direction: ltr''
will break on the left side.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>


<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<p>The following terms and abbreviations are used in this
module.

<dl>
<dt><dfn>UA</dfn>
<dt><dfn id="user-agent">User Agent</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A program that reads and/or writes CSS style sheets on behalf of a
user in either or both of these categories: programs whose purpose is
to render <span>documents</span> (e.g., browsers) and
programs whose purpose is to create style sheets (e.g., editors). A UA
may fall into both categories. (There are other programs that read or
write style sheets, but this module gives no rules for them.)

<dt><dfn title="document|documents">document</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A tree-structured document with elements and attributes, such as an
SGML or XML document [[XML11]].

<dt><dfn>style sheet</dfn>
<dd>
<p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style sheet</a>.
</dl>


<h3 id=conformance>Conformance</h3>

<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
letters in this specification. All of the text of this specification is
normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples,
and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
like this:

<div class="example">
  <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
</div>

<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<p>Conformance to CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3 is defined
for three classes:
<dl>
  <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
    <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
    style sheet</a>.
  <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A UA that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
    <span>documents</span> that use them.
  <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A UA that writes a style sheet.
</dl>

<p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3
if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
individual grammars of each property as given in this module.

<p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3
if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
appropriate specifications, it supports all the properties defined
by CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3 by parsing them correctly
and rendering the document accordingly. However the inability of a
UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

<p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Backgrounds and Borders
Level 3 if it writes syntactically correct style sheets, according
to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
property in this module.

<h3 id="levels">Levels</h3>

<p><em>This section is informative.</em> CSS has different levels of
features, each a subset of the other. (See [[CSSBEIJING]] for a full

</ul>

<h4 id="level-3">CSS Level 3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>All features described in the CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3
</ul>


<h3 id="exit">CR exit criteria</h3>

<p>As described in the W3C process document, a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate
Recommendation</a> (CR) is a specification that W3C recommends for use
on the Web. The next stage is “Recommendation,” when the
specification is sufficiently implemented.

<p>For this specification to be proposed as a W3C Recommendation, the
following conditions shall be met. There must be at least two
independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each
feature may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no
requirement that all features be implemented by a single product. For
the purposes of this criterion, we define the following terms:

<dl>
  <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
  different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
  used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
  have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
  exempt from this requirement.

  <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
  official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
  browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
  suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
  agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
  if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
  must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
  equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
  interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
  available for the purposes of peer review.

  <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:

  <ol class="inline">
    <li>implements the specification.

    <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
    be a shipping product or other publicly available version
    (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
    Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
    feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
    demonstrate stability.

    <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
    to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
    going forward).
  </ol>
</dl>

<p>A minimum of sixth months of the CR period must have elapsed. This
is to ensure that enough time is given for any remaining major errors
to be caught.

<p>Features will be dropped if two or more interoperable
implementations are not found by the end of the CR period.

<p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by
judgment of CSS WG) tests have not been produced for those feature(s)
by the end of the CR period.
