<tr class=a><td>

<p>Here is what I propose for floats in multicol:

<p>1) In [multicol] spec, remove special treatment for overflow of floats. Overflow floats should be clipped to the column exactly as any other kind of overflow would. This way, content that was initially designed for single-column layout has same behavior.

<p>2) Leave definition of floats that intrude across columns to GCPM [2]. In fact, page floats as currently defined in GCPM are powerful enough to work as shown in [1].

<tr><td>
In section 4, Column gaps and rules <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-multicol-20090630/#column-gaps-and-rules">[1]</a>:

<blockquote>"Column rules are only drawn between columns that have content."</blockquote>

Assuming column 2's entire content did not fit e.g. an image and needs to overflow to the next page, I assume column 2 is considered to have content in this case.

<tr class=a><td>I just noticed that there is still an example (example VI) in the 
non-normative section 1 that we forgot to delete, when we removed 
the 'column-break-*' properties from the draft.

<td>editorial, fixed

<tr class=a><td>The title is still "CSS3 module: Multi-column layout"

<p>Hadn't the WG decided to adopt consistent naming and in particular to
avoid saying CSS3?

<p>If yes, it should be called "CSS Multi-column Layout Module" or "CSS
Multi-column Layout Module Level 3" (although I guess that Level 3 is
only for features that did exist in level 2)

<td>Yes, the title should be aligned with the other names. "CSS Multi-column Layout Module" is a fitting name, as there is no previous level for multi-column layout.

<tr class=r><td>About column-rule-color:
Why UAs are required only to support CSS2 colors?
If the goal is to avoid the burden of hsl / rgba / SVG colors,
shouldn't that be delegated to a reduced profile?

<td>This is a general problem for several CSS modules; should they refer to CSS 2.1 or emerging CSS3 modules? In this case, it seems best to refer to CSS 2.1 and the draft has been edited to reflect this.

<tr class=a><td>About column breaks:

At the beginning of section 5, replace desrciption with description

<td>editorial

<tr><td>About column breaks: Is it possible to avoid a column break while still allow a page break?
Is the intended effect like:

<pre>
----------------------------------
| a bcd efg hij |                |
| lmn opq rst u |                |

/ page break, but content remains 
  in the same column /

| rst uvw xyz ab|                |
| cde fgh ijk l |                |
----------------------------------
</pre>

<td>A page break will always cause a column break; columns on different pages are considered to be different columns. This specification does not provide a way to ensure that all content is in the (say) left-most column. 

<tr><td>About column breaks: What about margin and collapsing of them?
If you're delegating all (not just properties) to css3-page, you
should say that explicitly.

<td>The specification states:

<blockquote>
A multi-column element establishes a new block formatting context, as per CSS 2.1 section 9.4.1.
</blockquote>

Which is correct, but somewhat cryptic. Therefore one example has been added:

<blockquote>
A top margin set on the first child element of a mulitcol element will not collase with the margins of the multicol element.
</blockquote>

Further, in the description of the "break" properties, this text now occurs:

<blockquote>
When a page or column break splits a box, the box's margins, borders, and padding have no visual effect where the split occurs. However, margins will be preserved after forced page/column break. A forced page/colum break is a break that does not occur naturally.
<blockquote>


<tr class=a><td>About overflow inside and outside the multicolum element: 

you should insert some examples of non-floated, overflowing,
clipped element (maybe inlines with long words)

<td>

An image with has been added.

<tr><td>About overflow inside and outside the multicolum element:

what happens if a non-floated element overflows vertically?
Is it still clipped regardless of overflow? Can implementations put
scrollbars, if overflow asks so?

<td>Yes, the spec states

<blockquot
Content that extend outside column boxes at the edges of the multi-column element is clipped according to the 'overflow' property.


<tr><td>About overflow inside and outside the multicolum element:

what happens if Example XVIII has an element that floats on
the rigth? Is the element clipped (showing only the right part), does
the element intrude (ignoring the side of the float), does overflow
apply?

<tr><td>About overflow inside and outside the multicolum element:

if there are more columns than available, are scrollbars
rendered when overflow:auto / scroll?

<tr><td>Section conformance names a "column-grid-image", but no definition
is provided in the document.

<td>I assume you refer to 'column-gap-image'. Indeed, this should be removed.
