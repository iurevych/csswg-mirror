	<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>The draft describes a CSS box model optimized for interface design.
	It provides an additional measure system alongside the ones already in
	CSS.  [[!CSS21]]  In this new box model, the children of a box are
	laid out either horizontally or vertically, and unused space can be
	assigned to a particular child or distributed among the children by
	assignment of "flex" to the children that should expand.
	Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside
	horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  This
	model is based on the box model in the XUL user-interface language
	used for the user interface of many Mozilla-based applications
	(such as Firefox).</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id="overview">
Overview</h2>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes, algorithms which determine the size and 
	position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor 
	boxes: block layout, designed for laying out documents and simple applications,
	inline layout, designed for laying out text,
	table layout, designed for laying out information in a tabular format, and 
	positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard 
	for other elements in the document. This module introduces a new layout mode, 
	flexbox layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and 
	webpages.</p>

	<p>Flexbox layout is superficially similar to block layout.  It lacks many of 
	the more complex text or document-formatting properties that can be used in 
	block layout, such as 'float' and 'columns', but in return it gains more simple
	and powerful tools for aligning its contents in ways that webapps and complex
	web pages often need.  The contents of a flexbox can be laid out in any direction,
	can have their order swapped around dynamically, and can "flex" their sizes
	and positions to respond to the available space.</p>

	<p>Similar to other layout modes such as table layout, a flexbox acts like a
	block when placed into other layout modes.  Inline flexboxes can also be declared, 
	which act like inline-blocks.</p>

	<p>Block-level and atomic inline-level children of the flexbox are referred
	to as <dfn>flexbox item</dfn>s in this specification.  Inline children are
	wrapped in anonymous blocks, and these anonymous blocks are also <i>flexbox item</i>s.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example:</p>

		<pre class=html>
&lt;p style="width: 400px; display: flexbox;">
	&lt;button style="width: 200px;">Child 1&lt;/button>
	&lt;button style="width: 100px;">Child 2&lt;/button>
&lt;/p>
		</pre>

		<p>In this example, the first button is 200 pixels wide and the second button is
		100 pixels wide. As the flexbox is 400 pixels wide, there is extra space left over
		which is placed after the two buttons but inside the flexbox. The placement of this
		extra space may be modified using the various flex properties described in the next
		sections. Neither the height of the buttons nor the height of the flexbox are specified,
		so the height is computed intrinsically from the content. In this case, the buttons
		will be the height needed to display the label and button border, and the flexbox will
		also be this height plus any margins around the buttons.</p>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id=display-flexbox>
New values for 'display' property</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:
				<td>display
			<tr>
				<th>New value:
				<td>flexbox | inline-flexbox
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p class=issue>ISSUE: The proliferation of "inline-*" display values is untenable and
	restrictive.  Table cells should be able to use the flexbox layout mode for 
	their contents, for example, rather than being forced to use block layout.
	It's expected that this will be fixed by splitting the 'display' property
	into subproperties controlling how the element formats its contents ('display-inside')
	and how it reacts to its surroundings ('display-outside').  Once that occurs,
	this section will instead describe a single new 'display-inside' value that 
	triggers flexbox layout.</p>

	<p>You can declare that an element is a flexbox, and thus should use flexbox 
	layout, by setting the 'display' property on the element to the value 
	''flexbox''.</p>

	<p>The special behaviors of a flexbox, such as flexing and reordering children,
	only apply to <i>flexbox item</i>s.  All block-level or atomic inline-level
	children of the flexbox are <i>flexbox item</i>s.  Contiguous runs of non-replaced
	inline children are wrapped in an anonymous block-level box, which is itself
	a <i>flexbox item</i>.

	<p class=note>Note that out-of-flow elements like absolutely positioned elements
	leave behind a 'placeholder' inline element in their original position in the
	document <span class=issue>(ISSUE: This will be defined in Positioned Layout.)</span>
	Floats are also out-of-flow, but children of flexboxes can't float.
	<span class=issue>(ISSUE: Should this restriction exist, or should I just wrap
	floats in the anonymous boxes like other inlines?)</span>  It is recommended
	that authors avoid creating inline flexbox children, as the anonymous block
	that is generated can't be targetted and controlled by the various flexbox
	properties.</p>

	<p>A flexbox item creates a new BFC.  The margins of a flexbox item 
	do not collapse with any other margin.  Flexboxes "shrinkwrap" their contents
	by default (when their 'width' or 'height' properties are ''auto''), similar
	to tables or floats.</p>

	<p>Setting ''display:flexbox'' on an element forces it to use a new layout 
	algorithm, and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of 
	block layout don't make sense in a flexbox context.  In particular:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module compute to their initial 
		values on a flexbox ('break-before', 'break-inside', and 'break-after' are still 
		valid on a flexbox).</li>
		<li>'float' and 'clear' compute to their initial values on a flexbox item</li>
		<li>'vertical-align' has no effect on a flexbox item</li>
		<li class=issue>[Others?]</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id=flex-direction>
Flexbox Direction: the 'flex-direction' property</h2>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:
				<td><dfn>flex-direction</dfn>
			<tr>
				<th>Values:
				<td>lr | rl | tb | bt | inline | inline-reverse | block | block-reverse
			<tr>
				<th>Initial:
				<td>inline
			<tr>
				<th>Applies To:
				<td>flexboxes
			<tr>
				<th>Inherited:
				<td>no
			<tr>
				<th>Computed Value:
				<td>lr | rl | tb | bt (See text)
			<tr>
				<th>Media:
				<td>visual
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>The 'flexbox-direction' property specifies how <i>flexbox item</i>s 
	are placed in the flexbox.  A value of ''lr'' means that 
	the first flexbox item is placed against the left edge of the flexbox, with 
	later children placed immediately to the right of the preceding flexbox item.  
	A value of ''rl'' is the same, but with the initial flexbox item 
	placed against the right edge of the flexbox and later children placed to the 
	left.  Both of these values mean that the flexbox is a <dfn>horizontal 
	flexbox</dfn>.  A value of ''tb'' means that the first flexbox 
	child is placed against the top edge of the flexbox, with later children placed 
	immediately below it, while ''bt'' means the first child is placed 
	against the bottom edge of the flexbox, with later children placed immediately 
	above it.  Both of these values mean that the flexbox is a <dfn>vertical 
	flexbox</dfn>.</p>

	<p>A value of ''inline'' computes to one of ''lr'', ''rl'', ''tb'', or ''bt'', 
	depending on the direction and block-flow of the flexbox: if the start side of
	the flexbox is the left side, ''inline'' must compute to ''lr''; similarly, if
	the start side of the flexbox is the right, top, or bottom side, ''inline''
	must compute to ''rl'', ''tb'', or ''bt'' respectively.  ''inline-reverse'',
	''block'', and ''block-reverse'' determine their computed value identically to
	''inline'', but use the location of the end side, before side, and after side
	of the flexbox, respectively.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p>A vertical flexbox can be used to emulate the functionality of HTML's
		''&lt;center>'' element:</p>
		<pre>
&lt;div>
	&lt;span>foo foo foo foo&lt;/span>
	&lt;span>bar bar&lt;br>bar bar&lt;/span>
	&lt;span>foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
&lt;style>
	div {
		display: flexbox;
		flex-direction: tb;
		width: 200px;
	}
	span {
		margin: 0 auto;
	}
&lt;/style>
		</pre>
		<p><img alt="" src="images/basic-vertical-flexbox.png"></p>
	</div>

	<p>In the rest of this specification, the direction in which new <i>flexbox item</i>s
	are laid out will be referred to as the <dfn>measure direction</dfn> (if a
	precise direction is required) or the <dfn>measure axis</dfn> (if only the axis
	orientiation is required).</p>

	<p>The axis perpendicular to the ''measure axis'' will be refered to as the
	<dfn>length axis</dfn>, with the <dfn>length direction</dfn> being
	either a line extending from the ''before'' side of the flexbox to the ''after''
	side, or from the ''start'' side of the flexbox to the ''end'' side, whichever
	would produce a direction parallel to the ''length axis''.</p>

	<p>Similarly, the <dfn>inner measure</dfn> is the width of the flexbox item in
	a horizontal flexbox, or the height in a vertical flexbox.  The <dfn>inner length</dfn>
	is the height of the flexbox item in a horizontal flexbox, or the width in a
	vertical flexbox.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id=flex-order>
Display Order: the 'flex-order' property</h2>

	<p><i>flexbox item</i>s are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order
	as they appear in the source document.  The 'flex-order' property may be used
	to change this ordering.</p>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-order</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;integer>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>1
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td><i>flexbox item</i>s</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
	</table>

	<p class=issue>Maybe name this 'flex-index' instead, to be consistent with 'z-index'.</p>

	<p><i>flexbox item</i>s may be assigned to ordinal groups using the 'flex-order'
	property.  This property is an integer with an initial value of 1.</p>

	<p>Ordinal groups control the order in which <i>flexbox item</i>s appear.  A flexbox
	will lay out its children starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and
	going up.  Elements with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they
	appear in the source document.

	<div class=example>
		<p>This example shows how ordinal groups might be used.</p>
		<pre><code>
	div { display: flexbox; }
	#span1 { flex-order: 2; }
	#span3 { flex-order: 2; }
	#span4 { flex-order: 1; }

	&lt;div>
		&lt;span id="span1">span1&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span2">span2&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span3">span3&lt;/span>
		&lt;span id="span4">span4&lt;/span>
	&lt;/div></code></pre>

		<p>The first ordinal group, 1, contains span2 and span4. As span2 does not 
		specify an ordinal group, it will default to 1. The elements will be displayed 
		in document order, so span2 will be displayed before span4. The second ordinal 
		group, 2, contains the remaining two spans. The resulting display order will 
		be:</p>

		<pre><code>span2 span4 span1 span3</code></pre>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id=flexibility>
Flexibility</h2>

	<p>The defining aspect of flexbox layout is the ability to make various lengths
	of the <i>flexbox item</i>s flexible.  Flexible lengths can be used for the 'width',
	'height', 'padding', and 'margin' properties of <i>flexbox item</i>s.  A 
	<dfn>flexible length</dfn> can grow if the flexbox has extra space available, 
	or shrink if the flexbox would otherwise overflow.  The ''flex()'' function
	is used to specify a <i>flexible length</i> and it's parameters.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p class=issue>TODO: Examples!</p>
	</div>

<h3 id=resolving-flexible-lengths>
Resolving Flexible Lengths</h3>

	<p>CSS resolves a <i>flexible length</i> into a definite length by first collecting
	all the lengths, flexible or inflexible, that will share some space.  For example,
	for a horizontal flexbox, the lengths of the left and right margins, left and right
	borders, left and right paddings, and widths of all <i>flexbox item</i>s share
	the width of the flexbox itself.  Conversely, each <i title="<i>flexbox item</i>s">flexbox item's</i>
	vertical margins, borders, padding, and height individually share the height
	of the flexbox.</p>

	<div class=figure>
		<p class="caption issue">TODO: Diagram showing the relevant lengths
		in each axis.</p>
	</div>

	<p>CSS then sums the <dfn>preflex size</dfn> of the lengths in each set.  The
	<i>preflex size</i> of an inflexible length is just the length itself.  The
	<i>preflex size</i> of a flexible length is its <i>preferred size</i>.  The
	<dfn>preferred size</dfn> defaults to ''0'', and can be set to a different value
	with the optional third argument to the ''flex()'' function (defined below).</p>

	<p>If the sum of all the <i title="preflex size">preflex sizes</i> is less than
	the available width/height of the flexbox, then the difference is split up among all the 
	<i title="flexible length">flexible lengths</i> with <dfn>positive flexibility</dfn>
	(a non-zero value for the first argument to the ''flex()'' function), with the
	space divvied up proportionally to the flexibility of each length.  If the sum
	is greater than the available width/height, then all the
	<i title="flexible length">flexible lengths</i> with <dfn>negative flexibility</dfn>
	(a non-zero value for the second argument to the ''flex()'' function) shrink
	in proportion to their flexibility to try and make the sum equal the available
	width/height.</p>
 
	<p>The 'flex-pack' and 'flex-align' properties offer more complex control over
	free-space distribution.  The precise details of how free space is determined 
	and assigned to flexible lengths is detailed in a later chapter.</p>
 
<h3 id=flex-function>
The ''flex()'' function</h3>
 
	<p>The ''flex()'' function is used to specify the parameters of a
	<i>flexible length</i>: the <i title="positive flexibility">positive</i> 
	and <i>negative flexibility</i>, and the <i>preferred size</i>.  The syntax
	of the ''flex()'' function is:</p>

	<pre class=prod>flex( <i title="positive flexibility">&lt;pos-flex></i> [, <i title="negative flexibility">&lt;neg-flex></i> [, <i title="preferred size">&lt;preferred-size></i> ]? ]? )</pre>

	<p>The first argument sets the <i>positive flexibility</i> of the length.
	It must be a non-negative &lt;number> - anything else is a syntax error.</p>

	<p>The second argument sets the <i>negative flexibility</i> of the length.
	It must also be a non-negative &lt;number>, with anything else being a syntax
	error.  This argument is optional; if omitted, it defaults to ''0''.</p>

	<p>The third and final argument sets the <i>preferred size</i> of the length.
	It must be a &lt;length> or a &lt;percentage>, or the keyword ''auto'' - 
	anything else is a syntax error.  This argument is also optional; if omitted,
	it defaults to ''0''.</p>

	<p>Between and around the margins of <i>flexbox item</i>s there are additional 
	flexible lengths, called <dfn>packing space</dfn>.  Packing space can absorb 
	leftover free space in a flexbox if there aren't any other <i>flexible length</i>s, 
	or if all the <i>flexible length</i>s have reached their maximum size.  The 
	'flex-pack' property defines the flexibility of these packing spaces:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn id=flex-pack-start>start</dfn></dt>
		<dd><i>flexbox item</i>s are packed toward the start of the flexbox.  The

		<dd><i>flexbox item</i>s are packed toward the end of the flexbox.  The

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<!-- Aborted new introduction to flexboxes
<p>A flexbox has two axes, which are treated differently by the space distribute algorithm:  the <i>measure axis</i>, which is the axis along which the flexbox grows as you add more children, and the <i>length axis</i>, which is the perpendicular axis.</p>

<img alt="In a horizontal flexbox, the measure axis is horizontal, while the length axis is vertical.">

<p>The measure axis is more interesting, as there are more places where things can potentially flex.  As such, there are more controls for specifying how to distribute free space in this axis: the 'width' or 'height' property starts things off, modified by the 'flex' property; the 'margin' property gives individual control over spacing between <i>flexbox item</i>s; and the 'flex-pack' property gives a more flexbox-global level of control over the between-children spacing.</p>

<p>In general terms, determining where to allocate free space in the measure axis starts by determining just how much free space there is.  All the non-flexible lengths, and the preferred sizes of all the flexible widths or heights, are subtracted from the total width or height of the flexbox.  If a positive length is left over, this is split up among all the flexible lengths according to their flexibility.  Flexible margins automatically have a flexibility of 1, while widths or heights have their flexibility specified by the 'flex-grow' property.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>Three boxes, all with a preferred size of 0, will end up with sizes exactly proportional to their flex-grow values.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>
<div class=example>
	<p>If the three boxes have different preferred sizes, then they'll split the free space proportionately, but their final sizes won't be exactly proportional.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>
<div class=example>
	<p>Margins can also participate in flex calculations.  They have a preferred size of 0, and a flexibility of 1.</p>
	<img alt="">
</div>

<p>If none of the lengths are flexible, or if all the flexible widths or height have reached their maximum size (if 'max-width' or 'max-height' properties are in effect), then any leftover space is distributed according to the 'flex-pack' property between the margins of the <i>flexbox item</i>s.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>If the flexbox is small enough, then the flexible child can absorb all the space...</p>
	<img>
	<p>...but if it gets large enough, there'll be extra space left over for 'flex-pack' to distribute.</p>
	<img>
</div>

<p>If the original calculation of how much free space was left gave a negative length (that is, if the preferred sizes of all the <i>flexbox item</i>s sum to a larger length than the width or height of the flexbox), then flexible margins get set to 0, 'flex-pack' has no effect, and <i>flexbox item</i>s with a non-zero 'flex-shrink' value split the responsibility for shrinking between themselves proportionally.  Just like when they grow, their size starts from the preferred size, then combines that with the proportional share of (negative) space.</p>

<div class=example>
	<p>When the children are too wide, the shrinkable elements reduce their size to fit...</p>
	<img>
	<p>...but if they all reach their minimum size, they just overflow.</p>

	<p>This step computes necessary information required to run the free-space 
	distribution algorithms.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Determine the measure of the flexbox.  Flexboxes are sized like shrinkwrapped
		blocks (if ''display:flexbox'' is used) or inline-blocks (if ''display:inline-flexbox''
		is used).  A horizontal flexbox's measure is its width, while a vertical
		flexbox's measure is its height.  <span class=issue>ISSUE: Do I need to 
		explicitly define the sizing algorithm?  I think I should be able to rely
		on the generic multi-directional block sizing algorithm, perhaps with a 
		specification of the inputs, like what size to use for flexible lengths.</span></li>

		<li>
			<p>Resolve all <i>relevant length</i>s on the flexbox and its 
			<i>flexbox item</i>s into <dfn>flex tuples</dfn> of [preferred size, 
			minimum size, maximum size, positive flex, negative flex].</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>For margins and padding:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Set the minimum size to 0 and the maximum size to infinity.</p>

					<p>If the length is inflexible, set the preferred size to the
					length itself and both positive and negative flexibility to 0.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, if the length was specified with the ''flex()'' function,
					set the positive flexibility, negative flexibility,
					and preferred size to the values specified in the function.</p>

					<p>If the length is a margin with the value ''auto'', set the 
					preferred size to 0, the positive flexibility to 1, and the negative
					flexibility to 0.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>For borders:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Borders are always inflexible.  Set the minimum size to 0, the
					maximum size to infinity, the preferred size to the border-width,
					and the positive and negative flexibility to 0.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>For width and height:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Set the minimum size to the value of the 'min-width' or 'min-height',
					as appropriate.  Set the maximum size to the value of the 'max-width'
					or 'max-height' property, as appropriate, unless the value is ''none'',
					in which case set the maximum size to infinity.</p>

					<p>If the length is inflexible, set the preferred size to the length
					itself and both positive and negative flexibility to 0.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, if the length was specified with the ''flex()'' function, 
					set the positive and negative flexibility to the values specified 
					in the function.  If the preferred size argument specified in the 
					function is a &lt;length>, set the preferred size to that length.  
					If the argment is a &lt;percentage>, resolve it relative to the
					width or height of the flexbox, as appropriate, and set the preferred
					size to the resultant length.  If the argument is ''auto'', 
					set the preferred size to the item's intrinsic dimension in the
					appropriate axis.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, if the length was ''auto'', set the preferred size
					to the item's intrinsic dimension in the appropriate axis, the positive 
					flexibility to 1, and the negative flexibility to 0.</p>

					<p>If the preferred size is now less than the minimum size, set 
					it equal to the minimum size.  If the preferred size is now greater 
					than the maximum size, set it equal to the maximum size.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>For <i>packing space</i>s:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>If the flexbox's 'flex-pack' is <i title=flex-pack-start>start</i>, 
					the last <i>packing space</i> (between the final <i>flexbox item</i>, 
					after reordering by 'flex-order', and the end of the flexbox) has 
					a minimum size of 0, a maximum size of infinity, a preferred size 
					of 0, a positive flexibility of 1, and a negative flexibility of 
					0.  All other <i>packing space</i>s have minimum size, maximum size, 
					preferred size, positive flexibility, and negative flexibility of 
					0.</p>

					<p>If the flexbox's 'flex-pack' is <i title=flex-pack-end>end</i>, 
					the first <i>packing space</i> (between the first <i>flexbox item</i>, 
					after reordering by 'flex-order', and the start of the flexbox) 
					has a minimum size of 0, a maximum size of infinity, a preferred 
					size of 0, a positive flexibility of 1, and a negative flexibility 
					of 0.  All other <i>packing space</i>s have minimum size, maximum 
					size, preferred size, positive flexibility, and negative flexibility 
					of 0.</p>

					<p>If the flexbox's 'flex-pack' is <i title=flex-pack-center>center</i>, 
					the first and last <i>packing space</i>s (as defined above) have 
					a minimum size of 0, a maximum size of infinity, a preferred size 
					of 0, a positive flexibility of 1, and a negative flexibility of 
					0.  All other <i>packing space</i>s have minimum size, maximum size, 
					preferred size, positive flexibility, and negative flexibility of 
					0.</p>

					<p>If the flexbox's 'flex-pack' is <i title=flex-pack-justify>justify</i>, 
					the first and last <i>packing space</i>s (as defined above) have

<h3 id=first-distribution-round>
First Distribution Round</h3>

	<p>This step distributes free space to the flexible lengths of the flexbox
	in the <i>measure axis</i>.</p>

	<p>Collect the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s that can participate in this step:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the flexbox is horizontal, collect the widths of every <i>flexbox item</i>.
		If the flexbox is vertical, instead collect the heights of every <i>flexbox item</i>.</li>

		<li>Collect the margins of every <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the flexbox's
		measure axis.</li>

		<li>Collect the borders of every <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the flexbox's
		measure axis, if the <i>flexbox item</i> has a 'box-sizing' value of ''content-box''
		or ''padding-box''.</li>

		<li>Collect the paddings of every <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the flexbox's
		measure axis, if the <i>flexbox item</i> has a 'box-sizing' value of ''content-box''.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Invoke the <i>free space allocation algorithm</i> with the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s
	collected above, and an <i>available free space</i> equal to the flexbox's 
	inner measure.</p>

<h3 id=second-distribution-round>
Second Distribution Round</h3>

	<p>This step distributes any leftover available space to the <i>packing space</i>,
	so that the flexbox items are arranged within the flexbox as desired.</p>

	<p>Collect the same set of <i>flex tuple</i>s as in the first distribution round
	(now inflexible lengths), and additionally collect the flexbox's <i>packing space</i>s.</p>

	<p>Invoke the <i>free space allocation algorithm</i> with the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s
	collected above, and an <i>available free space</i> equal to the flexbox's
	inner measure.</p>

<h3 id=intermediate-computation>
Intermediate Computation</h3>

	<p>Determine the length of the flexbox, given the sizes that have already
	been determined.</p>

<h3 id=third-distribution-round>
Third Distribution Round</h3>

	<p>This step distributes free space to the flexible lengths of each flexbox
	item in the <i>length axis</i>.  <strong>It is run for each <i>flexbox item</i>
	independently.</strong></p>

	<p class=issue>ISSUE: This step doesn't yet take 'flex-align' into account.
	I need to decide whether to always default to stretching or shrinking when
	doing baseline-alignment, or coming up with some heuristic for it.  Perhaps
	specify the behavior in the 'flex-align' values instead?  Once this decision
	is made, the behavior is relatively simple - either adjust margin (if shrunk)
	or padding (if stretched)

	<p>Collect the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s from the current <i>flexbox item</i>
	that can participate in this step:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the flexbox is horizontal, collect the height of the <i>flexbox item</i>.
		If the flexbox is vertical, instead collect the width of the <i>flexbox item</i>.</li>

		<li>Collect the margins of the <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the flexbox's 
		length axis.</li>

		<li>Collect the borders of the <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the flexbox's
		length axis, if the <i>flexbox item</i> has a 'box-sizing' value of ''content-box''
		or ''padding-box''.</li>

		<li>Collect the padding lengths of the <i>flexbox item</i> that are in the 
		flexbox's length axis, if the <i>flexbox item</i> has a 'box-sizing' value 
		of ''content-box''.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Invoke the <i>free space allocation algorithm</i> with the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s
	collected above, and an <i>available free space</i> equal to the flexbox's
	inner length.</p>

<h3 id=free-space-allocation-algorithm>
Free Space Allocation Algorithm</h3>

	<p>This section describes the algorithm used to allocate free space to a set
	of flexible lengths.  The inputs to this algorithm are a set of <i>flex tuple</i>s
	and a length representing the <i>available free space</i>, which may be positive
	or negative.  The output is a set of inflexible lengths.</p>

	<p>If the <i>available free space</i> is 0, transform all the <i>flex tuple</i>s
	into inflexible lengths equal to their preferred size and return them.</p>

	<p>If the <i>available free space</i> is a positive length, it will be distributed
	between all the <i>flex tuple</i>s with positive flexibility:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Sum the <i>positive flexibility</i> of all the <i>flex tuple</i>s.  This
		is the <i>total flexibility</i>.</li>

		<li>If the <i>total flexibility</i> is 0, transform all the <i>flex tuple</i>s
		into inflexible lengths equal to their preferred size and return them.</li>

		<li>
			<p>For each <i>flex tuple</i> with non-zero <i>positive flexibility</i>, 
			set its preferred size to:</p>

			<pre><code>[preferred size] + ( [available free space] * [positive flexibility] / [total flexibility] )</code></pre>
		</li>

		<li>If any <i>flex tuple</i>s now have a preferred size greater than their
		maximum size, set their preferred size to their maximum size, set their
		positive flexibility to 0, and restart this algorithm.</li>

		<li>Transform all the <i>flex tuple</i>s into inflexible lengths equal to
		their preferred size, and return them.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If the <i>available free space</i> is a negative length, all the <i>flex tuple</i>s
	with negative flexibility will shrink to attemp to fit the set of <i>flex tuple</i>s
	into the available space:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Sum the <i>negative flexibility</i> of all the <i>flex tuple</i>s.  This
		is the <i>total flexibility</i>.</li>

		<li>If the <i>total flexibility</i> is 0, transform all the <i>flex tuple</i>s
		into inflexible lengths equal to their preferred size and return them.</li>

		<li>
			<p>For each <i>flex tuple</i> with non-zero <i>negative flexibility</i>, 
			set its preferred size to:</p>

			<pre><code>[preferred size] + ( [available free space] * [negative flexibility] / [total flexibility] )</code></pre>

			<p class=note>Note that the <i>available free space</i> is a negative
			length here, so the sum will result in a smaller length.</p>
		</li>

		<li>If any <i>flex tuple</i>s now have a preferred size lesser than their
		minimum size, set their preferred size to their minimum size, set their
		negative flexibility to 0, and restart this algorithm.</li>

		<li>Transform all the <i>flex tuple</i>s into inflexible lengths equal to
		their preferred size, and return them.</li>

<h2 id="layout-interface">
Interface With Other Layout Algorithms</h2>

	<div class=issue>
		<p>This section seems necessary, but not the precise way it's written.  I
		need to identify precisely what data needs to be exposed both by the containing
		measure model (for the flexbox to use) and by the flexbox (for the containing
		measure model to use), and then write that up.  Then the other measure models
		we produce can re-use the same template.</p>

		<p>Need to define:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The min/max/fit-content widths and heights of flexboxes in block contents</li>
			<li>Other stuff?</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

<p>
	<!--
  <p>
   A box placed in a block is considered a block level element and will be positioned
   and sized according to the rules for CSS 2.1 (section 10.3 for widths). Specifically,
   the following equation applies for calculating the width:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + scrollbar width (if any) = width of containing block
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All children of 'box' elements are block-level. If inline-level elements are nested
     inside boxes, they get wrapped in an anonymous block which then takes part in the
     box layout.

  </p><p>
     If the width of a child of a flexible box is computed as 'auto', then the used value
     is the shrink-to-fit width. This calculation is done similarly to how the width of
     a floating element is determined. Otherwise if the width has a computed value,
     then that value is used as the width.
  </p><p>

     In a horizontally oriented box, the flexibility is then applied which may increase
     or decrease the used width. In a vertically oriented box, the position and size
     of the child may be adjusted by the value of the container's
     <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property.
  </p><p>

     The <span class="property">'min-width'</span>, <span class="property">'min-height'</span>,
     <span class="property">'max-width'</span>, and <span class="property">'max-height'</span>
     CSS properties act the same on boxes as on blocks.
  </p><p>

     The height of a child of a flexible box is determined in the same manner as specified
     in the CSS specification. The used height may further be adjusted by the container's
     <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property in a horizontally
     oriented box, or the flexibility in a vertically oriented box.
  </p><p>

     Note that it is possible for a horizontally oriented box that the height of a
     flexible child containing an inline descendant will change when the flexibility is
     applied. Similarly, in a vertically oriented box, the height of a child may change
     based on the <span class="property">'box-align'</span> property of the
     box.
