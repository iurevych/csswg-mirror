<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents
	(such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper,  in speech, etc. This module
	contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;4 relating to specifying and rendering external and generated images and, in some cases, general replaced content.
	It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level&nbsp;3 Image Values [[css3-images]] and CSS level&nbsp;2 [[CSS21]],
	which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1 [[CSS1]].
	The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;3 are <var class="replaceme">SUMMARIZE HERE</var>.

Stuff I'm Pulling From Images 3</h2>



<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="image-notation">
Image Annotations and Fallbacks: the ''image()'' notation</h3>

	<p>The ''image()'' notation allows an author to tag an image with a few types
	of useful processing instructions which can affect the rendering of the image
	and to declare fallback images to be used if the original image can't be
	decoded or is a type that the browser doesn't recognize.
	The author can specify the desired resolution the image should be rendered at,
	declare the directionality of an image so that it can be automatically be 
	reversed if used in text with a different directionality.</p>

	<p>So that authors can take advantage of CSS's forwards-compatible parsing
	rules to provide a fallback for image slices, implementations that support
	the ''image()'' notation <em>must</em> support the <code>xywh=#,#,#,#</code>
	form of media fragment identifiers for images. [[!MEDIA-FRAGS]]

	<p>The ''image()'' notation is defined as:

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>&lt;image-list></dfn> = 
	image( [ &lt;image-decl> , ]* [ &lt;image-decl> | &lt;color> ] )</pre>

	<p>where &lt;image-decl> is given by:</p>

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>&lt;image-decl></dfn> = 
	&lt;string> [ [ snap? && &lt;resolution> ] || [ ltr | rtl ] ]</pre>

	<p>Each <i>&lt;image-decl></i> represents the external image referenced
	by the URI given as the &lt;string> argument.</p>

	<p>If the image is a raster image and a &lt;resolution> is given, the image 
	must be rendered at that resolution.  This must override the default resolution
	given by the 'image-resolution' property.
	<span class='note'>Recall that the default resolution of raster images is ''1dppx'',
	so that one image pixel corresponds to one CSS ''px'' unit.</span>  If the 
	''snap'' keyword is also specified, and the specified resolution would make 
	one image pixel larger than one device pixel, the image must be rendered at 
	the specified resolution, rounded to the nearest value that would map one image 
	pixel to an integer number of device pixels; if the specified resolution would 
	make one image pixel smaller than one device pixel, the image must be rendered 
	at the specified resolution, rounded to the nearest value that would map an 
	integer number of image pixels to one device pixel.  If the image is a vector 
	image, specifying a resolution has no effect.</p>

	<p>If a directional keyword (''ltr'' or ''rtl'') is given, the image itself
	gains that directionality.  If the image is used in a property on an element
	with opposite directionality, is must be mirrored in the inline dimension
	when rendered.</p>

	<p>Multiple arguments can be given separated by commas, in which case the
	function represents the first &lt;image-decl> representing an image that
	the browser can successfully load and display.  The final argument can specify
	a &lt;color> to serve as an ultimate fallback; this can be used, e.g. for
	'background-image', to ensure adequate contrast if none of the preceding 
	&lt;image-decl>s can be used. If the final argument is a &lt;color>, it 
	represents a solid-color image of the given color with no <i>intrinsic
	dimensions</i>.

	<div class="example">
		<p>The rule below would tell the UA to load ''wavy.svg'' if
		it can; failing that to load ''wavy.png'' and display it at 150dpi;
		failing that to display ''wavy.gif''; and finally, if none of the images
		can be loaded and displayed, to use the color ''rgba(0,0,255,0.5)'' to create a
		dimensionless background image.  For example, the browser might not understand
		how to render SVG images, the PNG may be malformed, and the GIF might not 
		exist on the server and return 404 error instead of an image.</p>

		<pre>background-image: image(url(wavy.svg), 'wavy.png' 150dpi, "wavy.gif", rgba(0,0,255,0.5));</pre>

		<p>The 'background-size' property specifies that dimensionless images
		by default stretch to cover the entire background positioning area
		[[CSS3BG]], so if none of the specified images can be displayed
		the background will be painted semi-transparent blue. As with any image,
		this fallback will be painted over the 'background-color' (if any).</p>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='cross-fade-function'>
Combining images: the ''cross-fade()'' notation</h3>

	<p>When transitioning between images, CSS requires a way to explicitly refer 
	to the intermediate image that is a combination of the start and end images.  
	This is accomplished with the ''cross-fade()'' function, which indicates 
	the two images to be combined and how far along in the transition the 
	combination is.

	<p class="note">Authors can also use the ''cross-fade()'' function for many 
	simple image manipulations, such as tinting an image with a solid color or 
	highlighting a particular area of the page by combining an image with a 
	radial gradient.

	<p>The syntax for ''cross-fade()'' is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod><dfn>&lt;image-combination></dfn> = cross-fade( &lt;image>, &lt;image>, &lt;percentage> )</pre>

	<p>The function represents an image generated by combining the first and 
	second image (referred to in this section as the "start" and "end" images, 
	respectively).  The percentage represents how far along the transformation 
	is, with 0% representing the start image, 100% representing the end image, 
	and percentages between that representing corresponding combinations of the 
	two images.  The <code>&lt;percentage></code> must be between 0% and 100% inclusive;
	any other value is invalid.</p>

	<p>More precisely, given ''cross-fade(A,B,p)'', where <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
	are images and <var>p</var> is a percentage between 0% and 100%, the function represents
	an image with width equal to 
	<code>width<sub>A</sub> &times; (1-<var>p</var>) + width<sub>B</sub> &times; p</code>
	and height equal to
	<code>height<sub>A</sub> &times; (1-<var>p</var>) + height<sub>B</sub> &times; p</code>.
	The contents of the image must be constructed by first scaling <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> to the size of the 
	generated image, then applying
	<code>dissolve(<var>A</var>,1-<var>p</var>) plus dissolve(<var>B</var>,<var>p</var>)</code>.
	<span class='note'>The "dissolve()" function and "plus" compositing operator are defined
	in the literature by Porter-Duff.</span></p>

<h2 id="image-processing">
Image Processing</h2>

<h3 id="image-resolution">
Overriding Image Resolutions: the 'image-resolution' property</h3>

	<p>The <i>image resolution</i> is defined as the number of image
	pixels per unit length, e.g., pixels per inch. Some image formats can
	record information about the resolution of images. This information
	can be helpful when determining the actual size of the image in the
	formatting process. However, the information can also be wrong, in
	which case it should be ignored. By default, CSS assumes a resolution
	of one image pixel per CSS ''px'' unit; however, the 'image-resolution'
	property allows using some other resolution.

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>image-resolution</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>from-image || &lt;resolution>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>1dppx
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>all elements
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value
	</table>

	<p>The 'image-resolution' property specifies the resolution of all images used
	in or on the element: images in content (e.g. replaced elements and generated 
	content), background images, list markers, etc.  Values have the following 
	meanings:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>&lt;resolution></dt>
		<dd>The value sets the resolution of the image. In combination with
		''from-image'', the specified resolution is only used if the image
		does not have a resolution.</dd>

		<dt>from-image</dt>
		<dd>The UA must look for the resolution in the image itself. If the
		image does not have a resolution, the specified &lt;resolution>
		value is used, or ''1dppx'' if none is given.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>This property must have no effect on vector images, as vector images
	do not have a concept of "resolution".</p>

	<p class='note'>Note that for all images other than the contents of replaced
	elements, the ''image()'' function may be used to override the resolution set
	here.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>This rule specifies that the UA should use the image resolution
		found in the image itself, falling back to 1 image pixel per CSS
		''px'' unit.</p>

		<pre class=css>img { image-resolution: from-image }</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Using this rule, the image resolution is set to 300dpi and the
		resolution in the image, if any, is ignored.</p>

		<pre>img { image-resolution: 300dpi }</pre>
	</div>


	<div class="example">
		<p>These rules both specify that the UA should use the image resolution
		found in the image itself. If the image has no resolution, the
		resolution is set to 300dpi.</p>

	  <pre>
img { image-resolution: from-image 300dpi }
img { image-resolution: 300dpi from-image }
	  </pre>
	</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id="image-orientation">
Orienting an Image on the Page: the 'image-orientation' property</h3>

	<p>Images from camera phones, digital cameras or scanners may be encoded sideways.
	For example, the first row of image data may represent the leftmost or
	rightmost column of image pixels. Furthermore, often such devices have limited
	resources, and do not have the capability to rotate the image into an upright
	orientation. However, this type of device may have internal knowledge or can
	accept input from its user as to the rotational correction to perform.</p>

	<p>The image-orientation property provides a way to specify an "out-of-band"
	rotation to be applied to image source data. This facility is not intended to
	specify layout transformations such as arbitrary rotation or flipping the image
	in the horizontal or vertical direction. It is not needed to correctly orient
	an image when printing in landscape versus portrait orientation, as that
	rotation is done as part of layout. It should only be used to correct
	incorrectly-oriented images.</p>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>image-orientation</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;angle>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>0deg
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>images
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>no
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value, rounded and normalized (see text)
	</table>

	<p>'image-orientation' specifies an orthogonal rotation to be applied to an image
	before it is laid out. CSS layout processing applies to the image <em>after</em>
	rotation. This implies, for example:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The intrinsic height and width are derived from the rotated rather than the
		original image dimensions;</li>

		<li>The height (width) property applies to the vertical (horizontal) dimension
		of the image, <em>after</em> rotation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Positive values cause the image to be rotated to the right (in a clockwise
	direction), while negative values cause a rotation to the left.  The computed
	value of the property is calculated by rounding the specified angle to the 
	nearest quarter-turn	(90deg, 100grad, .25turn, etc.), rounding away from 0 
	(that is, 45deg is rounded	to 90deg, while -45deg is rounded to -90deg), then
	moduloing the value by 1 turn (360deg, 400grad, etc.).</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>The following example rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise:</p>

		<pre>
img.ninety     { image-orientation: 90deg }
...
&lt;img class="ninety" src=... />
		</pre>

		<p>The same effect could be achieved with, for example, an angle of -270deg
		or 450deg.</p>
	</div>

<h3 id='image-rendering'>
Determining How to Scale an Image: the 'image-rendering' property</h3>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>image-rendering</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>auto | crisp-edges<!-- | pixelated -->
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>auto
		<tr>
			<th>Applies to:
			<td>all elements
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:
			<td>specified value
	</table>

	<p>The 'image-rendering' property provides a hint to the user-agent about what aspects of an image are most important to preserve when the image is scaled, to aid the user-agent in the choice of an appropriate scaling algorithm.  When specified on an element, it applies to all images given in properties for the element, such as background images, list-style images, or the content of replaced elements when they represent an image that must be scaled.  The values of the 'image-rendering' property are interpreted as follows:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="image-rendering-auto">auto</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The image should be scaled with an algorithm that maximizes the appearance of the image, possibly smoothing colors or introducing minor blur.  This value is intended for use with photos and similar "real-life" images.</p>
			
			<p>For example, algorithms such as bilinear interpolation or lancosz interpolation are acceptable.  Lesser or greater algorithms may be used as well; in high-load situations, user agents may choose to use a very cheap algorithm such as nearest-neighbor, while in low-load situations they may choose to use a very expensive and high-quality scaling algorithm.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>crisp-edges</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The image should be scaled with an algorithm that preserves contrast and edges in the image, and which does not smooth colors or introduce blur to the image in the process.  This is intended for images such as pixel art, or diagrams with sharp, straight lines.  When downscaling an image, some color-smoothing is acceptable, but should not introduce blurriness.</p>

			<p>For example, when upscaling an image, algorithms such as nearest-neighbor are acceptable, as are specialized pixel-art scaling algorithms like EPX or <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/">the algorithm described in this SIGGRAPH paper</a>.  When downscaling an image, algorithms such as nearest-neighbor or bilinear interpolation are acceptable.</p>
		</dd>

		<!--<dt><dfn>pixelated</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The image should be scaled with an algorithm that preserves a "pixelated" look.  This is intended for images such as pixel art.</p>

			<p>If the image is upscaled an integer multiple of its original size, it must be scaled with the nearest-neighbor algorithm.  When upscaled by any other factor, nearest-neighbor is acceptable, as are other algorithms that preserve a pixelated look.  When downscaling an image, any algorithm that preserves a pixelated look are acceptable, such as nearest-neighbor or bilinear interpolation.</p>
		</dd>-->
	</dl>

	<p>This property does <em>not</em> dictate any particular scaling algorithm to be used.  For example, with ''image-rendering:auto'', a user agent might scale images with bilinear interpolation by default, switch to nearest-neighbor interpolation in high-load situations, and switch to a high-quality scaling algorithm like Lanczos interpolation for static images that aren't moving or changing.  Similarly, with ''image-rendering:crisp-edges'', a user agent might scale images with nearest-neighbor interpolation by default, and switch to EPX interpolation in low-load situations.</p>

	<p>This property must only have an effect on raster images.  Vector images can be upscaled or downscaled infinitely without losing detail, and thus do not require any hints as to what details are important to preserve.</p>

	<p>This property previously accepted the values ''optimizeSpeed'' and ''optimizeQuality''.  These are now deprecated; a user agent may accept them as valid values, but must treat them as aliases for the ''auto'' value.</p>

	<p class=issue>dbaron suggests that optimizeSpeed should instead alias to crisp-edges.</p>

<h2 id='interpolation'>
Interpolation</h2>

	<p>This section describes how to interpolate between new value types defined 
	in this specification, for use with modules such as CSS Transitions and CSS 
	Animations.</p>

	<p>If an algorithm below simply states that two values should be "interpolated" 
	or "transitioned" without further details, then the value should be interpolated 
	as described by the Transitions spec.  Otherwise, the algorithm may reference 
	a variable "t" in its detailed description of the interpolation.  This is a 
	number which starts at 0% and goes to 100%, and is set to a value that represents 
	the progress through the transition, based on the duration of the transition, 
	the elapsed time, and the timing function in use.  For example, with a linear 
	timing function and a 1s duration, after .3s t is equal to 30%.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h3 id='interpolating-images'>
Interpolating <i>&lt;image></i></h3>

	<p>All images can be interpolated, though some special types of images (like 
	some gradients) have their own special interpolation rules.  In general terms, 
	images are interpolated by scaling them to the size of the start image and 
	cross-fading the two while they transition to the size of the end image.</p>

	<p>In specific terms, at each point in the interpolation the image is equal 
	to <code>cross-fade(&lt;start image>, &lt;end image>, t)</code>.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h3 id='interpolating-image-combinations'>
Interpolating <i>&lt;image-combination></i></h3>

	<p>Combinations of the same images at different progress points can be
	smoothly animated by simply animating the progress.  Theoretically, this 
	produces the same visual effect as the generic &lt;image> interpolation
	would; in practice, implementations may have slight differences due to
	how they scale or rasterize images.  Additionally, the generic &lt;image>
	interpolation produces nested cross-fade() functions, which is undesirable
	if it can be avoided.</p>

	<p>If both the starting and ending images are &lt;image-combination>s with the
	same image arguments, they must be interpolated by interpolating their third
	argument, the percentage.  Otherwise, they must be interpolated as generic
	&lt;image>s.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h3 id='interpolating-gradients'>
Interpolating <i>&lt;gradient></i></h3>

	<p>Gradient images can be interpolated directly in CSS transitions and 
	animations, smoothly animating from one gradient to another.  There are only 
	a few restrictions on what gradients are allowed to be interpolated:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Both the starting and ending gradient must be expressed with the same 
		function.  (For example, you can transition from a linear-gradient() to 
		a linear-gradient(), but not from a linear-gradient() to a radial-gradient() 
		or a repeating-linear-gradient().)</li>

		<li>Both the starting and ending gradient must have the same number of 
		color-stops.  For this purpose, a repeating gradient is considered to 
		have infinite color-stops, and thus all repeating gradients have the same 
		number of color-stops.  (Note that one may pad a gradient with additional 
		color-stops placed atop each other, if necessary to make two gradients 
		have the same number of color-stops.)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If the two gradients satisfy both of those constraints, they must be 
	interpolated as described below.  If not, they must be interpolated as a 
	generic image.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Convert both the start and end gradients to their explicit forms:
			<dl>
				<dt>For linear gradients:</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>If the direction is specified as an	&lt;angle>, it 
						is already in its explicit form.</li>

						<li>Otherwise, if the direction is specified as a single
						keyword, change 'bottom' to '0deg', 'left' to '90deg', 
						'top' to '180deg', or 'right' to '270deg'.</li>

						<li>Otherwise, if the direction is specified as two
						keywords, change the direction to an &lt;angle> in the 
						following ranges that would produce an equivalent
						gradient: for 'bottom left' or 'left bottom', the angle must
						be between 0deg and 90deg; for 'top left' or
						'left top', the angle must be between 90deg and 
						180deg;	for 'top right' or 'right top', the angle
						must be between 180deg and 270deg; for 'bottom right' or
						'right bottom', the angle must be between 270deg and 360deg.</li>

						<li>If both the start and end gradients had their direction
						specified with keywords, and the absolute difference 
						between the	angles their directions mapped to is greater 
						than 180deg, add 360deg to the direction of the gradient 
						with the smaller angle.  <span class='note'>This ensures 
						that a transition from, for example, "right" (270deg) to 
						"bottom" (0deg) rotates the gradient a quarter-turn 
						clockwise, as expected, rather than rotating 
						three-quarters of a turn counter-clockwise.</span></li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>For radial gradients:</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>If the size is specified as two &lt;length>s or
						&lt;percentage>s, it is already in its explicit form.</li>

						<li>Otherwise, the size must be changed to a pair of 
						&lt;length>s that would produce an equivalent
						ending-shape.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>

		<li>Interpolate each component and color-stop of the gradients independently.  
		For linear gradients, the only component is the angle.  For radial gradients, 
		the components are the horizontal and vertical position of the center 
		and the horizontal and vertical axis lengths.</li>

		<li>To interpolate a color-stop, first match each color-stop in the start 
		gradient to the corresponding color-stop at the same index in the end 
		gradient.  For repeating gradients, the first specified color-stop in 
		the start and end gradients are considered to be at the same index, and 
		all other color-stops following and preceding are indexed appropriately.  
		Then, for each pair of color-stops, interpolate the position and color 
		independently.</li>
	</ol>

Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.
	
	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
	
	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:
	
	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
	
	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance Classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>
	
	<p>A style sheet is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
	have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
	individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
	
	<p>A renderer is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var> by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
	
	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.</p>
	
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
	
	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	</p>
 
<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
	
	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.
	
	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

	<p class=issue>[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
	the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

	<p id='cr-exit-criteria'>
	For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
	there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
	of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
	products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
	a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
	following terms:
	
	<dl>
		<dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
		different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
		used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
		have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
		exempt from this requirement.
	
		<dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
		official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
		browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
		suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
		agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
		if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
		must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
		equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
		interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
		available for the purposes of peer review.
	
		<dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
	
		<ol class=inline>
			<li>implements the specification.
	
			<li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
			be a shipping product or other publicly available version
			(i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
			Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
			feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
			demonstrate stability.
	
			<li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
			to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
			going forward).
		</ol>
	</dl>
	
	<p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
	six months.
