- changed transform-origin definition to match background-origin.
- clarify that transform-origin is relative to the border box.

- removed the suggestion that position: relative could trigger a
  mode where transforms affect page layout. The feature is still being
  considered, but this is not a viable way to achieve it.
- removed the Point and CSSTransformValue interfaces. The point conversion
  APIs will move to CSSOM View. The CSSTransformValue interface is on
  hold while the CSSValue replacement is developed.
- added pseudo-code for matrix decomposition
